# LectorPlus

**Lector** is an extraction tool that is able to extract facts from English Wikipedia article text, learning the ways that are commonly used to express properties between named entities in the text. **LectorPlus** is an extension in which we adapted the tool to extract facts for the Spanish, the Italian, the French and the German version of Wikipedia.

Lector takes as input a Wikipedia (XML) dump and a DBPedia dump (in one of the language above), and outputs a .ttl file containing the list of triples that have been extracted. 

More information is available at the Lector homepage: http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/db/lector/
