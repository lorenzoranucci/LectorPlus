The [[Apple II series|Apple II]], also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because of its character cell-based color graphics and [[open architecture]]. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface called the [[Disk II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple II History Chapter 4 | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | author=Steven Weyhrich| date=April 21, 2002 | accessdate=August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first &quot;[[killer application|killer app]]&quot; of the business world: [[VisiCalc]], a [[spreadsheet]] [[Computer program|program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lemvc&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

By the end of the 1970s, Apple had a staff of computer designers and a production line.

Jobs was immediately convinced that all future computers would use a graphical user interface ([[Graphical user interface|GUI]]), and development of a GUI began for the [[Apple Lisa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2006/03/30/apple-at-30-1976-to-1986/|title=Apple at 30&amp;nbsp;– 1976 to 1986 | work=World of Apple|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, however, he was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemlisa&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

Retrieved March 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; due to its high price and limited range of software titles. The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be sold at a reasonable price, and [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package. It has been suggested that the combination of these three products were responsible for the creation of the desktop publishing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm|title=When was desktop publishing invented?|accessdate=April 30, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070420204531/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/beginners/f/when_dtp.htm| archivedate= April 20, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macintosh was particularly powerful in the desktop publishing market due to its advanced graphics capabilities, which had necessarily been built in to create the intuitive Macintosh GUI.

In 1985, a power struggle developed between Jobs and CEO [[John Sculley]], who had been hired two years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas. [http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/john-sculley-years-apple.html Growing Apple with the Macintosh: The Sculley years], ''Low End Mac'', February 22, 2006. Retrieved March 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple board of directors instructed Sculley to &quot;contain&quot; Jobs and limit his ability to launch expensive forays into untested products. Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a [[Coup d'état#Other uses of the term|coup]] and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;lem1985&quot; /&gt; Jobs resigned from Apple and founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Spector| first = G| title = Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market| work = [[PC Week]]| page = 109| date = September 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Macintosh_portable.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Macintosh Portable]], released in 1989, was Apple's first battery-powered portable Macintosh personal computer.]]
After Jobs' departure, the Macintosh product line underwent a steady change of focus to higher price points, the so-called &quot;high-right policy&quot; named for the position on a chart of price vs. profits. Jobs had argued the company should produce products aimed at the consumer market and aimed for a $1000 price for the Macintosh, which they were unable to meet. Newer models selling at higher price points offered higher [[profit margin]], and appeared to have no effect on total sales as [[power user]]s snapped up every increase in power. Although some worried about pricing themselves out of the market, the high-right policy was in full force by the mid-1980s, notably due to [[Jean-Louis Gassée]]'s mantra of &quot;fifty-five or die&quot;, referring to the 55% [[profit margin]]s of the [[Macintosh II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This policy began to backfire in the last years of the decade as new desktop publishing programs appeared on [[IBM PC compatible|PC clones]] that offered some or much of the same functionality of the Macintosh but at far lower price points. The company lost its monopoly in this market, and had already estranged many of its original consumer customer base who could no longer afford their high priced products. The Christmas season of 1989 was the first in the company's history that saw declining sales, and led to a 20% drop in Apple's stock price.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gassée's objections were overruled, and he was forced from the company in 1990. Later that year, Apple introduced three lower cost models, the [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC]] and [[Macintosh IIsi]], all of which saw significant sales due to pent up demand.

In 1991, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]], replacing the &quot;luggable&quot; [[Macintosh Portable]] with a design that set the current shape for almost all modern laptops. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for the [[Classic Mac OS]]. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot; /&gt; For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Apple believed the [[Apple II series]] was too expensive to produce and took away sales from the low-end Macintosh.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html#11|title=Apple II History Chap 11|accessdate=August 12, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080912044443/http://apple2history.org/history/ah11.html| archivedate= September 12, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Apple released the [[Macintosh LC]], which featured a single [[Expansion card|expansion slot]] for the [[Apple IIe Card]] to help migrate Apple II users to the Macintosh platform;&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2history11&quot; /&gt; the [[Apple IIe]] was discontinued in 1993.

The success of Apple's lower-cost consumer models, especially the LC, also led to cannibalization of their higher priced machines. To address this, management introduced several new brands, selling largely identical machines at different price points aimed at different markets. These were the high-end [[Macintosh Quadra|Quadra]], the mid-range [[Macintosh Centris|Centris]] line, and the ill-fated [[Macintosh Performa|Performa]] series. This led to significant market confusion, as customers did not understand the difference between models.&lt;ref name=&quot;vawperforma&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Macintosh Performa|url=http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130419164519/http://www.vectronicsappleworld.com/profiles/performa.html|archivedate=April 19, 2013 | publisher= Vectronics Apple World| accessdate= November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple also experimented with a number of other unsuccessful consumer targeted products during the 1990s, including [[Apple QuickTake|digital cameras]], [[PowerCD|portable CD audio players]], [[AppleDesign Powered Speakers|speakers]], [[Apple Bandai Pippin|video consoles]], the [[eWorld]] online service, and [[Apple Interactive Television Box|TV appliances]]. Enormous resources were also invested in the problem-plagued [[Newton (platform)|Newton division]] based on John Sculley's unrealistic market forecasts.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Ultimately, none of these products helped and Apple's market share and stock prices continued to slide.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Throughout this period, Microsoft continued to gain market share with [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] by focusing on delivering software to cheap commodity personal computers, while Apple was delivering a richly engineered but expensive experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Q4.06/3EC02E78-FD4D-4CDF-92A0-9C4CBDFAB3D2.html|title=1990–1995: Why the World Went Windows| accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple relied on high profit margins and never developed a clear response; instead, they sued Microsoft for using a GUI similar to the [[Apple Lisa]] in ''[[Apple Computer, Inc. v.

[[File:Newton-IMG 0320 cleanup.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Newton (platform)|Newton]] was Apple's first foray into the [[personal digital assistant|PDA]] markets, as well as one of the first in the industry. Despite being a financial flop at the time of its release, it helped pave the way for the [[PalmPilot]] and Apple's own [[iPhone]] and [[iPad]] in the future.]]

By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as [[A/UX]]. The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall|accessdate=August 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| archivedate= September 24, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Apple allied with [[IBM]] and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]] with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range=|title=Power Macintosh 6100|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's success during this period was evident in its stock price. Between early 2003 and 2006, the price of Apple's stock increased more than tenfold, from around $6 per share (split-adjusted) to over $80. In January 2006, Apple's [[market cap]] surpassed that of [[Dell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;modell&quot;&gt;Gamet, Jeff.

Since 2001, Apple's design team has progressively abandoned the use of translucent colored plastics first used in the [[iMac G3]]. This design change began with the [[titanium]]-made [[PowerBook]] and was followed by the [[iBook]]'s white [[polycarbonate]] structure and the flat-panel [[iMac]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10738727_ITM &quot;Apple revamps iBook.

On December 16, 2008, Apple announced that 2009 would be the last year the corporation would attend the Macworld Expo, after more than 20 years of attendance, and that senior vice president of Worldwide Product Marketing [[Philip W.

The official press release explained that Apple was &quot;scaling back&quot; on trade shows in general, including Macworld Tokyo and the Apple Expo in Paris, France, primarily because the enormous successes of the Apple Retail Stores and website had rendered trade shows a minor promotional channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHUNKIER SIDEKICK TO REPLACE JOBS AT MACWORLD|url=http://doeswhat.com/2008/12/16/chunkier-sidekick-to-replace-jobs-at-macworld/|work=DoesWhat|publisher=DoesWhat|accessdate=March 23, 2014|date=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple Announces Its Last Year at Macworld|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/12/16Apple-Announces-Its-Last-Year-at-Macworld.html|work=Apple Press Info|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=March 23, 2014|author=Steve Dowling|date=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of speculation and multiple rumored &quot;leaks&quot;, Apple announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the [[iPad]] on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch-based operating system as the iPhone, and many iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch, despite very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US.

===Apple TV===
{{Main article|Apple TV}}

At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]] (previously known as the iTV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and played video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html |title= Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate= October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB hard disk drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A software update released on January 15, 2008 allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/|first=Ross |last=Miller|title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010|publisher=AOL |work=[[Engadget]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101002001956/http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/| archivedate= October 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including [[YouTube]] and [[Netflix]], and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

At the September 9, 2015 event, Apple unveiled an overhauled Apple TV, which now runs a variant of OS X, [[tvOS]], and contains 32GB or 64 GB of NAND Flash to store games, programs, and to cache the current media playing.  The release also coincided with the opening of a separate Apple TV App Store and a new [[Siri Remote]] with a glass [[touchpad]], [[gyroscope]] and [[microphone]].

===Software===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
[[File:WWDC 2011 Moscone West Exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]] is held annually by Apple to showcase its new software and technologies for software developers.]]

Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[OS X|macOS]], the latest version being [[macOS Sierra]] (version 10.12). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its macOS operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]] and [[GarageBand]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both macOS and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[OS X Server|macOS Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Final Cut Pro]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro]], a comprehensive music toolkit; and [[Motion (software)|Motion]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[iCloud]], which provides cloud storage and syncing for a wide range of data, including email, contacts, calendars, photos and documents. It also offers iOS device backup, and is able to integrate directly with third-party apps for even greater functionality. iCloud is the fourth generation of online services provided by Apple, and was preceded by [[MobileMe]], .Mac and iTools, all which met varying degrees of success.

===Electric vehicles===

According to the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Apple wants to start producing an [[electric car]] with [[autonomous driving]] as soon as 2020.

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a [[fruitarian]] diet. Jobs thought the name &quot;Apple&quot; was &quot;fun, spirited and not intimidating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html|accessdate=October 21, 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597|title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion | date=September 26, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/|title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&amp;nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo|title= Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo|first=Ivan|last=Raszl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot; /&gt; This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to [[Alan Turing#Death|his method of suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising |location=UK |work=The Independent |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | date=January 4, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091003003651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html| archivedate= October 3, 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff |date=March 14, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html |archivedate=March 14, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=David|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much; Alan Turing and the invention of the computer|year=2007|page=280|location=Phoenix|isbn=978-0-7538-2200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 1999&lt;ref name=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;/&gt; (the year following the introduction of the [[iMac G3]]), Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation.

What people are responding to is much bigger than the object.

In February 2015, Apple opened their new 180,000-square-foot headquarters in [[Herzliya]], [[Israel]], which will accommodate approximately 800 employees. This opening was Apple's third office located within Israel; the first, also in Herzliya, was obtained as part of the [[Anobit]] acquisition, and the other is a research center in [[Haifa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/New-Tech/Apple-CEO-Tim-Cook-to-inaugurate-new-Israeli-headquarters-next-week-390866|title=Apple CEO Tim Cook to inaugurate new Israeli headquarters next week|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2015/02/12/tim-cook-apple-israel-offices/|title=Tim Cook reportedly headed to Israel for opening of new Apple offices|work=9to5Mac|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stores===
Apple has 478 retail stores ({{as of|2016|03|lc=y}}) in seventeen countries&lt;ref name=&quot;storenum&quot;/&gt; and an [[Apple Store (online)|online store]] available in 39 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple online stores&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/us/browse/open/country_selector|title=The Apple Store – International|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each store is designed to suit the needs of the location and regulatory authorities.

The Apple Store in [[Regent Street]], [[London]], was the first to open in Europe in November 2004, and is the most profitable shop in London with the highest sales per square foot, taking £60,000,000 pa, or £2,000 per square foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple Store London&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2010|url=http://www.macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/apple_store_regent_street_the_most_profitable_shop_in_london_for_its_size|title=Apple Store London|publisher=Macdailynews|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Regent Street store was surpassed in size by the nearby Apple Store in [[Covent Garden]], which was surpassed in size by the [[Grand Central Terminal]] Apple Store, [[New York City]], in December 2011.

Of the 43,000 Apple employees in the United States 30,000 work at Apple Stores. Apple Store employees make above average pay for retail employees and are offered money toward college as well as gym memberships, [[401(k)|401k]] plans, healthcare plans, product discounts, and reduced price on purchase of stock.&lt;ref name=9to5624&gt;{{cite news|title=New York Times profiles Apple’s retail operations and employees|url=http://9to5mac.com/2012/06/23/new-york-times-profiles-apples-retail-operations-and-employees/#more-196816|accessdate=June 24, 2012|newspaper=9 to 6 Mac|date=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 2016 ''[[Business Insider]]'' article featuring a lengthy interview with a [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] Apple Store retail worker highlighted significant dissatisfactions and issues for retail workers, including harassment and death threats from customers, an intense internal criticism policy that feels &quot;like a cult&quot;, a lack of any significant bonus if a worker manages to secure a business contract worth &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot;, a lack of promotion opportunities, and, despite a &quot;generous&quot; discount on any Apple product or Apple stock, are paid so little that many workers are unable to buy products themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jim|last=Edwards|title=NEVER MIND THE DEATH THREATS: An Apple Store worker tells us what it's really like working for Apple|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/qa-with-an-apple-store-worker-2016-5?r=UK&amp;IR=T&amp;IR=T|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=May 28, 2016|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate culture===
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of [[corporate culture]]. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the &quot;1984&quot; television commercial, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/| archivedate= December 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.&lt;ref name=Fortune1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup|title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steve Wozniak and Andy Hertzfeld 1985.jpg|thumb|[[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] in 1985]]
As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often take longer than projects with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultofmacwork&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple|title=What It's Like To Work At Apple|first=John|last=Brownlee|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having &quot;best-in-class&quot; employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]]—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup – Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a &quot;directly responsible individual,&quot; or &quot;DRI&quot; in Apple jargon.&lt;ref name=Fortune1/&gt; As an example, when iOS senior vice president [[Scott Forstall]] refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned [[Apple Maps|Maps app]], he was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|title=Inside Apple's major shakeup|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/29/inside-apples-major-shakeup/|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/apple-ceo-gets-modest-2012-pay-after-huge-2011-1.1092906|title=Apple CEO gets modest 2012 pay after huge 2011|date=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial article in ''[[The Verge]]'' in September 2016 by technology journalist Thomas Ricker explored some of the public's perceived lack of innovation at Apple in recent years, specifically stating that Samsung has &quot;matched and even surpassed Apple in terms of smartphone industrial design&quot; and citing the belief that Apple is incapable of producing another breakthrough moment in technology with its products. He goes on to write that the criticism focuses on individual pieces of hardware rather than the ecosystem as a whole, stating &quot;Yes, iteration is boring. But it’s also how Apple does business. [...] It enters a new market and then refines and refines and continues refining until it yields a success&quot;. He acknowledges that people are wishing for the &quot;excitement of revolution&quot;, but argues that people want &quot;the comfort that comes with harmony&quot;. Furthermore, he writes that &quot;a device is only the starting point of an experience that will ultimately be ruled by the ecosystem in which it was spawned&quot;, referring to how decent hardware products can still fail without a proper ecosystem (specifically mentioning that [[Walkman]] didn't have an ecosystem to keep users from leaving once something better came along), but how Apple devices in different hardware segments are able to communicate and cooperate through the [[iCloud]] cloud service with features including Universal Clipboard (in which text copied on one device can be pasted on a different device) as well as inter-connected device functionality including Auto Unlock (in which an [[Apple Watch]] can unlock a [[Macintosh|Mac]] in close proximity). He argues that Apple's ecosystem is its greatest innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Thomas|last=Ricker|title=First Click: Apple’s greatest innovation is its ecosystem|url=http://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12828846/apple-s-greatest-product-is-its-ecosystem|publisher=[[The Verge]]|date=September 7, 2016|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer service===
In 1999 Apple retained Eight Inc. as a strategic retail design partner and began creating the Apple retail stores. Tim Kobe of Eight Inc. prepared an &quot;Apple Retail&quot; white paper for Jobs, outlining the ability of separate Apple retail stores to directly drive the Apple brand experience—Kobe used their recently completed work with The North Face and Nike as a basis for the white paper.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The first two Apple Stores opened on May 19, 2001 in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and [[Glendale, California]].

A media article published in July 2013 provided details about Apple's &quot;At-Home Apple Advisors&quot; customer support program that serves as the corporation's call center. The advisors are employed within the U.S. and work remotely after undergoing a four-week training program and testing period. The advisors earn between US$9 and $12 per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Apple Gets At-Home Workers To Work|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/how-apple-gets-at-home-workers-to-work/?ncid=tcdaily|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=July 29, 2013|author=Ashley Verrill|date=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: “Nobody wants to buy sour milk”.&lt;ref name=supply/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed &amp;#124; Smart Shift &amp;#124; Executive &amp;#124; Financial Post |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since joined the industry standards groups to influence the future direction of technology standards such as [[USB]], [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[NVM Express|NVMe]], [[PCI Express|PCIe]] and others in its products. [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]] and is a legally mandated port in all Cable TV boxes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404152533/http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html |archivedate=April 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor practices====
{{further information|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Labor practices}}
The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of [[outsourcing]] initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by the ''[[New York Times]]'', Apple insiders &quot;believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Charles | last1=Duhigg | first2=Keith | last2=Bradsher | title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class | date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple immediately launched an investigation after the 2006 media report, and worked with their manufacturers to ensure acceptable working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morphy |first=Ericka |url=http://www.macnewsworld.com/story/61454.html |title=Apple, IT and the Specter of Sweatshop Labor |publisher=Mac New World |date=January 31, 2008 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Apple started yearly audits of all its suppliers regarding [[worker's rights]], slowly raising standards and pruning suppliers that did not comply.

The [[Foxconn suicides]] occurred between January and November 2010, when 18&lt;ref name=tian&gt;{{cite news | title=Struggle for Foxconn girl who wanted to die | work=South China Morning Post | date=December 15, 2010 | author=Lau, Mimi | location=Wuhan, Hubei}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foxconn]] (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted [[suicide]], resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.&lt;ref name=tian/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpreport&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Foxconn factories are labour camps: report | work=South China Morning Post | date=October 11, 2010 | author=Tam, Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A41M920101105|title=Foxconn worker plunges to death at China plant: report|publisher=Reuters|date=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 6:05&amp;nbsp;am EDT --&gt; The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ-Foxconn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704026204575267603576594936.html|title=Apple, H-P to Examine Asian Supplier After String of Deaths at Factory|author=Jason Dean|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=May 29, 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author1=William Foreman|title=Tech: Apple Supplier Foxconn Suffers 10th Death This Year, Asks Workers To Sign Anti-Suicide Pledge|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/25/foxconn-suffers-10th-deat_n_588524.html|accessdate=20 December 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huff&quot; /&gt; Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire&quot; /&gt;

Also in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/wintek-employees-sue/ |title=Workers Plan to Sue iPhone Contractor Over Poisoning |first=Brian X. |last=Chen |date=May 14, 2010 |publisher=Wired |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16231588|title=Suicides at Foxconn: Light and death|publisher=Economist|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1285980/Revealed-Inside-Chinese-suicide-sweatshop-workers-toil-34-hour-shifts-make-iPod.html |title=Revealed: Inside the Chinese suicide sweatshop where workers toil in 34-hour shifts to make your iPod &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 7, 2011 |first1=Andrew |last1=Malone |first2=Richard |last2=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to n-[[hexane]], a [[neurotoxin]] that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/26/3048024.htm Workers poisoned while making iPhones] ABC News, October 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2010/s3044840.htm Dirty Secrets] ABC Foreign Correspondent, 2010-Oct-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/n-hexane/recognition.html Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for n-Hexane]{{dead link|date=August 2016}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504125822/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/n-hexane/recognition.html |date=May 4, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, OSHA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: “We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple under fire again for working conditions at Chinese factories|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2|accessdate=December 20, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=December 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a Zhen Ding Technology factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65-hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in &quot;primitive, dark and filthy dorms&quot; where they sleep &quot;on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.&quot; Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Jamieson (December 23, 2014).

===Environmental practices and initiatives===

====Energy and resources====

Following a [[Greenpeace]] protest, Apple released a statement on April 17, 2012, committing to ending its use of coal and shifting to 100% renewable clean energy.&lt;ref name=&quot; After Greenpeace Protests, Apple Promises to Dump Coal Power &quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Wired Magazine]] |url= http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/05/apple_coal/|title= After Greenpeace Protests, Apple Promises to Dump Coal Power|accessdate=August 22, 2013|first=Robert|last=McMillan|date=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Powering Our Facilities with Clean, Renewable Energy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Wired Magazine]] |url= http://www.apple.com/environment/renewable-energy/|title= Powering Our Facilities with Clean, Renewable Energy |accessdate=August 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013 Apple was using 100% renewable energy to power their data centers. Overall, 75% of the company's power came from clean renewable sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Burrows |title=Apple Says Data Centers Now Use 100% Renewable Energy |publisher=Business Week |date=March 21, 2013 |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-03-21/apple-says-data-centers-now-use-100-percent-renewable-energy |accessdate=August 30, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223855/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-03-21/apple-says-data-centers-now-use-100-percent-renewable-energy |archivedate=December 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category &quot;Striding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a &quot;stuck icon&quot;, adding that Apple at the time was &quot;a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwclimate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672|title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2016}}, 100% of Apple's U.S. operations run on [[renewable energy]], 100% of Apple's [[data center]]s run on renewable energy and 93% of Apple's global operations run on renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.apple.com/environment/ |title=Environment|website=Apple |language=en-US |access-date=2016-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool]] (EPEAT) allows consumers to see the effect a product has on the environment. Each product receives a Gold, Silver, or Bronze rank depending on its efficiency and sustainability. Every Apple [[Tablet computer|tablet]], [[Laptop|notebook]], [[desktop computer]], and [[Computer monitor|display]] that EPEAT ranks achieves a Gold rating, the highest possible. Although Apple's data centers recycle water 35 times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.apple.com/environment/climate-change/ |title=Environment - Climate Change|date=March 2016|website=Why we measure our carbon footprint so rigorously.|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=March 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the increased activity in retail, corporate and data centers also increase the amount of water use to 573 million gallons in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/06/15/how-much-water-do-apple-data-centers-use/ |title=How Much Water Do Apple Data Centers Use?|work=Data Center Knowledge|accessdate= November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Greenpeace evaluated the state of the Green Internet and commended Apple on their environmental practices saying, &quot;Apple’s commitment to renewable energy has helped set a new bar for the industry, illustrating in very concrete terms that a 100% renewable Internet is within its reach, and providing several models of intervention for other companies that want to build a sustainable Internet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/click-clean/#report|title=ClickClean|website=Click Clean|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an event on March 21, 2016, Apple provided a status update on its environmental initiative to be 100% renewable in all of its worldwide operations. [[Lisa P. Jackson]], Apple's vice president of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives who reports directly to CEO, Tim Cook, announced that as of March 2016, 93% of Apple's worldwide operations are powered with renewable energy. Also featured was the company's efforts to use sustainable paper in their product packaging; 99% of all paper used by Apple in the product packaging comes from [[Post-consumer|post-consumer recycled]] paper or sustainably-managed forests, as the company continues its move to all paper packaging for all of its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2015.pdf |title=Apple Environmental Responsibility Report (2015)|date=|website=|publisher=Apple Inc.|access-date=March 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Responsibility_Report_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Apple working in partnership with [[The Conservation Fund|Conservation Fund]], have preserved 36,000 acres of working forests in [[Maine]] and [[North Carolina]]. Another partnership announced is with the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] to preserve up to 1,000,000 acres of forests in China. Featured was the company's installation of a 40 [[Megawatt|MW]] [[Solar power|solar power plant]] in the [[Sichuan]] province of [[China]] that was tailor made to coexist with the indigenous yaks that eat hay produced on the land, by raising the panels to be several feet off of the ground so the yaks and their feed would be unharmed grazing beneath the array.  This installation alone compensates for more than all of the energy used in Apple's Stores and Offices in the whole of China, negating the company's energy carbon footprint in the country. In [[Singapore]], Apple has worked with the Singaporean government to cover the rooftops of 800 buildings in the city-state with solar panels allowing Apple's Singapore operations to be run on 100% renewable energy. Liam was introduced to the world, an advanced robotic disassembler and sorter designed by Apple Engineers in California specifically for recycling outdated or broken iPhones. Reuses and recycles parts from traded in products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/ |title=Watch the Apple Special Event|website=Apple |access-date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple announced on August 16, 2016, that Lens Technology, one of its major suppliers in China, has committed to power all its [[glass production]] for Apple with 100 percent renewable energy by 2018. The commitment is a large step in Apple's efforts to help manufacturers lower their carbon footprint in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/17/lens-technology-renewable-energy-apple/ |title=Supplier Lens Technology Commits to 100 Percent Renewable Energy for Apple Manufacturing|last=Sumra|first=Husain |access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also announced that all 14 of its final assembly sites in China are now compliant with [[UL (safety organization)|UL's]] Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The standard, which started in January 2015, certifies that all manufacturing waste is [[reuse]]d, [[Recycling|recycled]], [[compost]]ed, or converted into energy (when necessary). Since the program began, nearly, 140,000 metric tons of waste have been diverted from [[landfill]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/08/17Apple-Announces-Environmental-Progress-in-China-Applauds-Supplier-Commitment-to-Clean-Energy.html |title=Apple - Press Info - Apple Announces Environmental Progress in China &amp; Applauds Supplier Commitment to Clean Energy|website=www.apple.com |access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Apple was featured in Greenpeace's Guide to Greener Electronics, which ranks electronics manufacturers on sustainability, climate and energy policy, and how &quot;green&quot; their products are. The company ranked fourth of fifteen electronics companies (moving up five places from the previous year) with a score of 4.6/10 down from 4.9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112022636/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/climate-change/cool-it/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/? |archivedate=November 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenpeace praises Apple's [[Sustainability metrics and indices|sustainability]], noting that the company exceeded its 70% global recycling goal in 2010. It continues to score well on the products rating with all Apple products now being free of PVC plastic and BFRs. However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot; /&gt; In January 2012, Apple requested that its cable maker, Volex, begin producing [[Halogen-free substance|halogen-free]] [[USB]] and power cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ash|title=Apple Power Cables to Become Even More Environmentally Friendly|url=http://www.keynoodle.com/apple-power-cables-to-become-even-more-environmentally-friendly/|publisher=KeyNoodle|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tax practices====
{{further information|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Tax practices}}

Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to ''The New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the &quot;[[Double Irish with a Dutch sandwich]],&quot; which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duhigg|first1=Charles|last2=Kocieniewski|first2=David|title=How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=April 29, 2012|location=Reno, Nevada|date=April 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Roland|title=Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax'|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece|newspaper=The Times|date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebrahimi|first=Helia|title=Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=November 2, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a matter of [[Public records|public record]] that Apple Inc. is the single largest taxpayer to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] of the [[United States|United States of America]] with an [[Tax rate|effective tax rate]] of approximately of 26% as of the Second Quarter of the Apple [[Fiscal year|Fiscal Year]] 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.apple.com|title=Apple - Investor Relations|website=investor.apple.com|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Reuters]] reported that Apple had earnings abroad of $54.4 billion which were untaxed by the [[IRS]] of the United States. Under U.S. tax law governed by the [[Tax law|IRC]], corporations don't pay income tax on overseas profits unless the profits are repatriated into the United States and as such Apple argues that to benefit its [[shareholder]]s it will leave it overseas until a repatriation holiday or comprehensive tax reform takes place in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drawbaugh|first1=Kevin|last2=Temple-West|first2=Patrick|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/09/us-usa-tax-offshore-idUSBREA3729V20140409|title=Untaxed U.S. corporate profits held overseas top $2.1 trillion: study|work=Reuters|accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/investor/earnings-call/|title=Apple Earnings Call|website=Apple|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, 2016, after a three-year investigation by the EU's competition commissioner that concluded that Apple received &quot;illegal state aid&quot; from Ireland, the EU ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion), plus interest, in unpaid taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple 13 billion euros&quot;&gt;Kanter, James and Scott, Mark (August 30, 2016) [http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html Apple Must Pay Billions for Tax Breaks in Ireland, E.U. Orders] The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the commissioner found that Apple had benefitted from Irish Department of Revenue tax rulings that allowed it to split the profits recorded by Apple Sales International internally between its Irish branch and a stateless &quot;head office&quot; entity lacking employees or premises (permitted under Irish law until 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_STATEMENT-16-2926_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Statement by Commissioner Vestager on state aid decision that Ireland's tax benefits for Apple were illegal|website=europa.eu|access-date=2016-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chancellor of [[Austria]], [[Christian Kern]], put this decision into perspective by stating that &quot;every [[Vienna|Viennese]] cafe, every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/technology/apple-tax-eu-ireland.html Amazon and Starbucks pay less tax than sausage stall, says Austria] BBC News, September 2, 2016.

===Litigation===
{{main article|Apple Inc. litigation}}
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Court Cases Involving Apple, Inc.|url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/AllNaturesOfSuit/Apple%2C%20Inc./|publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc.|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include ''[[Apple v. Samsung]]'', ''[[Apple v. Microsoft]]'', ''[[Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.]]'', and ''[[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]]''. Apple has also had to defend itself against charges on numerous occasions of violating intellectual property rights.  Most have been dismissed in the courts as [[Shell corporation|shell companies]] known as [[patent troll]]s, with no evidence of actual use of [[patent]]s in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/01/virnetx-kicks-off-final-massive-patent-trolling-attempt-vs-apple/|title=Patent troll VirnetX wants jury to give it a half-billion dollars of Apple’s cash|website=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy stance ===
Apple has made clear its stance on privacy and as such has made available Transparency Reports on the Governmental Requests it receives. Apple states plainly, &quot;On devices running [[iOS 8]] and later versions, your personal data is placed under the protection of your passcode.&lt;sup&gt;[[IPhone|[305]]]&lt;/sup&gt; For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an [[encryption key]] that is tied to the user’s passcode, which Apple does not possess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/privacy/transparency-reports/|title=Privacy - Transparency Reports - Apple|website=Apple|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its latest “Who Has Your Back?” report, once again the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) awarded Apple 5 out of 5 stars “commend[ing] Apple for its strong stance regarding user rights, transparency, and privacy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-government-data-requests-2015|title=Who Has Your Back?

Following media reports about [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]], NSA's massive electronic [[Mass surveillance|surveillance program]], in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Apple. According to leaks of said program, Apple joined the PRISM program in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Greenwald | first1 = Glenn | last2 = MacAskill | first2 = Ewen | title = NSA Prism program taps in to user data of Apple, Google and others | date = June 7, 2013 | work = [[The Guardian]] | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/us-tech-giants-nsa-data }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, Apple donated $2.5 million to the [[American Red Cross]] to aid relief efforts after [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Seth|title=Apple donates $2.5M to Hurricane Sandy relief|url=http://9to5mac.com/2012/11/09/apple-donates-2-5-million-to-hurricane-sandy-relief/|publisher=9to5Mac|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2016, Apple and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) announced that they have engaged in a partnership to, &quot;help protect life on our planet.&quot; Apple released a special page in the [[App Store (iOS)|iTunes App Store]], Apps for Earth. In the arrangement, Apple has committed that through April 24, WWF will receive 100% of the proceeds from the applications participating in the App Store via both the purchases of any paid apps and the In-App Purchases. Apple and WWF’s Apps for Earth campaign raised more than $8 million in total proceeds to support WWF’s conservation work. WWF announced the results at WWDC 2016 in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/help-the-planet-one-app-at-a-time|title=Help the planet.
