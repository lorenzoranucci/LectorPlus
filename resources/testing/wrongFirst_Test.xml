:''Not to be confused with Romans named &quot;Catulus&quot;, see [[Catulus]].''
'''Gaius Valerius Catullus''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|t|ʌ|l|ə|s}}; c. 84 – 54 BC) was a [[Latin poetry|Latin poet]] of the late [[Roman Republic]] who wrote in the [[neoteric]] style of poetry, which is about personal life rather than classical heroes. [[Poetry of Catullus|His surviving works]] are still read widely, and continue to influence poetry and other forms of art.

Catullus' poems were widely appreciated by other poets. He greatly influenced poets such as [[Ovid]], [[Horace]], and [[Virgil]]. After his rediscovery in the late [[Middle Ages]], Catullus again found admirers. His explicit writing style has shocked many readers. Indeed, Catullus' work was never canonical in schools, although his body of work is still frequently read from secondary school to graduate programs across the world.

==Life==
Gaius Valerius Catullus ({{IPA-la|ˈɡaː.i.ʊs waˈɫɛ.ri.ʊs kaˈtʊl.lʊs|classical}}) was born to a leading [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family of [[Verona, Italy|Verona]], in [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. The social prominence of the Catullus family allowed the father of Gaius Valerius to entertain [[Julius Caesar]] when he was the [[Promagistrate]] (proconsul) of both [[Gaul|Gallic]] [[Roman province|provinces]].&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/gaius-valerius-catullus/|title=Gaius Valerius Catullus|work=www.BookRags.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catullus was raised primarily by his mother, Blandus, who exposed him to poetry and the works of [[Sappho]] and [[Callimachus]] at a young age.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In a poem, Catullus describes his happy homecoming to the family villa at [[Sirmio]], on [[Lake Garda]], near Verona; he also owned a villa near the resort of [[Tivoli, Italy|Tibur]] (Tivoli).&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

Catullus appears to have spent most of his young adult years in Rome. His friends there included the poets [[Licinius Macer Calvus|Licinius Calvus]], and [[Helvius Cinna]], Quintus Hortensius (son of [[Quintus Hortensius|the orator]] and rival of [[Cicero]]) and the biographer [[Cornelius Nepos]], to whom Catullus dedicated a ''libellus'' of poems,&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; the relation of which to the extant collection remains a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;M. Skinner, Authorial Arrangement of the Collection, pp. 46–48, in: A Companion to Catullus, Wiley-Blackwell, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to have been acquainted with the poet [[Marcus Furius Bibaculus]]. A number of prominent contemporaries appear in his poetry, including Cicero, Caesar and [[Pompey]]. According to an anecdote preserved by [[Suetonius]], Caesar did not deny that Catullus's lampoons left an indelible stain on his reputation, but when Catullus apologized, he invited the poet for dinner the very same day.&lt;ref&gt; Suetonius ''Divus Iulius'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:phi,1348,011:73 73]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catullus at Lesbia's by Sir Laurence Alma Tadema.jpg|thumb|left|''Catullus at Lesbia's'' by Sir [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]
It was probably in Rome that Catullus fell deeply in love with the &quot;[[Lesbia]]&quot; of his poems, who is usually identified with [[Clodia|Clodia Metelli]], a sophisticated woman from the aristocratic house of patrician family Claudii Pulchri, sister of the infamous [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], and wife to proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer. In his poems Catullus describes several stages of their relationship: initial euphoria, doubts, separation, and his wrenching feelings of loss. Clodia had several other partners; “From the poems one can adduce no fewer than five lovers in addition to Catullus: Egnatius (poem 37), Gellius (poem 91), Quintius (poem 82), Rufus (poem 77), and Lesbius (poem 79).” There is also some question surrounding her husband’s mysterious death in 59 B.C., some critics believing he was domestically poisoned. Yet, a sensitive and passionate Catullus could not relinquish his flame for Clodia, regardless of her obvious indifference to his desire for a deep and permanent relationship. In his poems, Catullus wavers between devout, sweltering love and bitter, scornful insults that he directs at her blatant infidelity (as demonstrated in poems 11 and 58). His passion for her is unrelenting— yet it is unclear when exactly the couple split up for good. Catullus's poems about the relationship display striking depth and psychological insight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe, Jr.|first=Quincy|title=Introduction to Catullus, The Complete Poems for American Readers|year=1970|publisher=E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., Inc.|location=New York|pages=vii to xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He spent the provincial command year summer 57 to summer 56 BC in [[Bithynia]] on the staff of the commander [[Gaius Memmius (Poet)|Gaius Memmius]]. While in the East, he traveled to the [[Troad]] to perform rites at his brother's tomb, an event recorded in a moving poem.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

[[Image:REmpire-29 Bithynia.png|thumb|right|[[Bithynia]] within the Roman Empire]]
There survives no ancient biography of Catullus:  his life has to be pieced together from scattered references to him in other ancient authors and from his poems. Thus it is uncertain when he was born and when he died. [[St. Jerome]] says that he died in his 30th year, and was born in 87 BC. But the poems include references to events of 55 and 54 BC. Since the Roman consular fasti make it somewhat easy to confuse 87–57 BC with 84–54 BC, many scholars accept the dates 84 BC–54 BC,&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; supposing that his latest poems and the publication of his ''libellus'' coincided with the year of his death. Other authors suggest 52 or 51 BC as the year of the poet's death.&lt;ref&gt;M. Skinner, Introduction, p.3, in: A Companion to Catullus, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Though upon his elder brother's death Catullus lamented that their “whole house was buried along” with the deceased, the existence (and prominence) of ''Valerii Catulli'' is attested in the following centuries. [[T.P. Wiseman]] argues that after the brother's death Catullus could have married, and that, in this case, the later ''Valerii Catulli'' may have been his descendants.&lt;ref&gt;T.P. Wiseman, The Valerii Catulli of Verona, in: M. Skinner, ed., A Companion to Catullus, Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Poetry of Catullus}}
[[File:Catullus et in eum commentarius.tif|thumb|''Catullus et in eum commentarius'' (1554)]]

===Sources and organization===
Catullus's poems have been preserved in an [[anthology]] of 116 ''carmina'' (the actual number of poems may slightly vary in various editions), which can be divided into three parts according to their form: sixty short poems in varying meters, called ''[[polymetra]]'', eight longer poems, and forty-eight [[epigram]]s.

There is no scholarly consensus on whether Catullus himself arranged the order of the poems. The longer poems differ from the ''polymetra'' and the epigrams not only in length but also in their subjects: There are seven [[hymn]]s and one mini-[[epic poetry|epic]], or epyllion, the most highly prized form for the &quot;[[Neoteric#Latin Neoterics|new poets]]&quot;.

The ''polymetra'' and the epigrams can be divided into four major [[Theme (literature)|thematic]] groups (ignoring a rather large number of poems that elude such categorization):

* poems to and about his friends (e.g., an invitation like poem 13).
* [[erotic]] poems: some of them ([[Catullus 50|50]] and [[Catullus 99|99]]) indicate homosexual penchants, but most are about women, especially about one he calls &quot;[[Lesbia]]&quot; (which served as a false name for his married girlfriend, [[Clodia]], source and inspiration of many of his poems).
* [[invective]]s: often rude and sometimes downright [[obscene]] poems targeted at friends-turned-traitors (e.g., poem [[Catullus 16|16]]), other lovers of Lesbia, well-known poets, politicians (e.g., [[Julius Caesar]]) and [[rhetor]]s, including Cicero.
* [[condolence]]s: some poems of Catullus are solemn in nature. [[Catullus 96|96]] comforts a friend in the death of a loved one; several others, most famously [[Catullus 101|101]], lament the death of his brother.

All these poems describe the lifestyle of Catullus and his friends, who, despite Catullus's temporary political post in Bithynia, lived their lives withdrawn from politics. They were interested mainly in poetry and love. Above all other qualities, Catullus seems to have valued ''venustas'', or charm, in his acquaintances, a theme which he explores in a number of his poems. The ancient Roman concept of ''virtus'' (i.e. of [[virtue]] that had to be proved by a political or military career), which [[Cicero]] suggested as the solution to the societal problems of the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]], meant little to them.

However Catullus does not reject traditional notions, but rather their particular application to the ''[[vita activa]]'' of politics and war. Indeed, he tries to reinvent these notions from a personal point of view and to introduce them into human relationships. For example, he applies the word ''fides'', which traditionally meant faithfulness towards one's political allies, to his relationship with Lesbia and reinterprets it as unconditional faithfulness in love. So, despite seeming frivolity of his lifestyle, Catullus measured himself and his friends by quite ambitious standards.

===Intellectual influences===
Catullus's poetry was influenced by the innovative poetry of the [[Hellenistic Age]], and especially by [[Callimachus]] and the Alexandrian school, which had propagated a new style of poetry that deliberately turned away from the classical [[epic poetry]] in the tradition of [[Homer]]. Cicero called these local innovators  ''[[neoteroi]]'' (νεώτεροι) or 'moderns' (in Latin ''[[Neoteric#Latin Neoterics|poetae novi]]'' or '[[Neoteric#Latin Neoterics|new poets]]'), in that they cast off the heroic model handed down from [[Ennius]] in order to strike new ground and ring a contemporary note. Catullus and Callimachus did not describe the feats of ancient [[hero]]es and gods (except perhaps in re-evaluating and predominantly artistic circumstances, e.g. poems 63 and 64), focusing instead on small-scale personal themes. Although these poems sometimes seem quite superficial and their subjects often are mere everyday concerns, they are accomplished works of art. Catullus described his work as ''expolitum'', or polished, to show that the language he used was very carefully and artistically composed.

Catullus was also an admirer of [[Sappho]], a female poet of the seventh century BC, and is the source for much of what we know or infer about her. [[Catullus 51]] follows [[Sappho 31]] so closely that some believe the later poem to be, in part, a direct translation of the earlier poem, and [[Catullus 61|61]] and [[Catullus 62|62]] are certainly inspired by and perhaps translated directly from lost works of Sappho. Both of the latter are ''[[Epithalamium|epithalamia]]'', a form of [[wikt:laudatory|laudatory]] or erotic wedding-poetry that Sappho had been famous for but that had gone out of fashion in the intervening centuries. Catullus twice used a meter that Sappho developed, called the Sapphic [[strophe]] in poems [[Catullus 11|11]] and 51. In fact, Catullus may have brought about a substantial revival of that form in Rome.

Catullus, as was common to his era, was greatly influenced by stories from Greek and Roman myth. His longer poems—such as [[Catullus 63|63]], [[Catullus 64|64]], [[Catullus 65|65]], [[Catullus 66|66]], and [[Catullus 68|68]]—allude to mythology in various ways. Some stories he refers to are the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], the departure of the [[Argonauts]], [[Theseus]] and the Minotaur, [[Ariadne]]'s abandonment, [[Tereus]] and [[Procne]], as well as [[Protesilaus|Protesilaus and Laodamia]].

===Style===
Catullus wrote in many different meters including hendecasyllabic verse and elegiac couplets (common in love poetry). All of his poetry shows strong and occasionally wild emotions especially in regard to [[Lesbia]]. Lesbia, known for having multiple suitors, always showed little affection towards Catullus. He also demonstrates a great sense of humour such as in [[Catullus 13]].

===Musical settings===
''Catullus Dreams'' (2011) is a song cycle by David Glaser set to texts of Catullus. The cycle is scored for soprano and seven instruments. It was premiered at Symphony Space in New York by soprano Linda Larson and Sequitur Ensemble. 

''[[Catulli Carmina]]'' is a [[cantata]] by [[Carl Orff]] to the texts of Catullus.

&quot;Carmina Catulli&quot; is a song cycle arranged from 17 of Catullus' poems by American composer Michael Linton. The cycle was recorded in December 2013 and premiered at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall in March 2014 by French baritone Edwin Crossley-Mercer and pianist Jason Paul Peterson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://refinersfire.us/linton-carmina-catulli/ | publisher=RefinersFire | title=New Release: Linton: Carmina Catulli | accessdate=October 8, 2014 | date=August 19, 2014 | last=McMurtry | first=Chris | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008192346/http://refinersfire.us/linton-carmina-catulli/ | archivedate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/2/Recordings/LINTON__Carmina_Catulli.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forumopera.com/cd/carmina-catulli-priape-lesbie-diane-et-caetera&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catullus 5]], the love poem &quot;Vivamus mea Lesbia atque amemus&quot;, in the translation by [[Ben Jonson]] was set to music&lt;ref&gt;http://gerbode.net/ft2/composers//Ferrabosco/songs/06_come_my_celia/pdf/06_come_my_celia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ([[lute]] accompanied song) by [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger]]. [[Thomas Campion]] also wrote a lute-song using his own translation of the first six lines of Catullus 5 followed by two verses of his own. The translation by [[Richard Crashaw]] was set to music&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/3/37/Web-com.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a four-part [[Glee (music)|glee]] by Samuel Webbe Jr. It was also set to music&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/images/5/52/Smi-let.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in a three-part [[Glee (music)|glee]] by [[John Stafford Smith]].

Finnish jazz singer Reine Rimón has recorded poems of Catullus set to standard jazz tunes.

The Icelandic composer, Johann Johannsson, set [[Catullus 85]] to music. The poem is sung through a [[vocoder]]. The music is played by a [[string quartet]] and [[piano]]. Titled &quot;Odi Et Amo&quot;, the song is found on Johannsson's album [[Englaborn]].

'''Classics''' or '''classical studies''' is the study of [[classical antiquity]]. This covers the ancient Mediterranean world, particularly [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]. It encompasses the study of ancient languages, literature, philosophy, history, and archaeology. Traditionally in the [[Western world|West]], the study of the Greek and Roman classics was considered one of the cornerstones of the [[humanities]] and a necessary part of a rounded education. Since the 20th century, however, the popularity of the discipline has declined.

The literature of ancient Greece and Rome has been studied continuously since it was written, though it was only in the 16th century that it began to be referred to as the classics in the modern sense. In the 19th century, the discipline of classics broadened, with other aspects of the study of the classical world, such as history and archaeology, being included within it. From the 20th century, however, the traditional domination of the classics as part of elite education in the West has been eroded.

==Etymology==
The word ''Classics'' is derived from the [[Latin]] [[adjective]] ''classicus'', meaning &quot;belonging to the highest class of citizens&quot;. The word was originally used to describe the members of the highest class in ancient Rome. By the 2nd century AD the word was used in literary criticism to describe writers of the highest quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Aulus Gellius]], in his ''Attic Nights'', contrasts &quot;classicus&quot; and &quot;proletarius&quot; writers.&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Noctes Atticae'', 19.8.15.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century AD, the word had acquired a second meaning, referring to pupils at a school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-17&quot;/&gt; Thus the two modern meanings of the word, referring both to literature considered to be of the highest quality, and to the standard texts used as part of a curriculum, both derive from Roman use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-17&quot;/&gt;

==History==

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Catullus, Itally.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a bronze bust of a man.  It rests on a stone plinth, on which the words &quot;Gaius Valerius Catullus 87 AC&amp;ndash;54 AC&quot; are written.|The Roman poet Catullus was virtually unknown during the medieval period, in contrast to his modern popularity.]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], classics and education were tightly intertwined; according to Jan Ziolkowski, there is no era in history in which the link was tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval education taught students to imitate earlier classical models,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Latin continued to be the language of scholarship and culture, despite the increasing difference between literary Latin and the vernacular languages of Europe during the period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-21&quot;/&gt;

While Latin was hugely influential, however, Greek was barely studied, and Greek literature survived almost solely in Latin translation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The works of even major Greek authors such as Hesiod, whose names continued to be known by educated Europeans, were unavailable in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-22&quot;/&gt;  Along with the unavailability of Greek authors, there were other differences between the classical canon known today and the works valued in the Middle Ages.  [[Catullus]], for instance, was almost entirely unknown in the medieval period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-22&quot;/&gt;  The popularity of different authors also waxed and waned throughout the period: [[Lucretius]], popular during the [[Carolingian renaissance|Carolingian]] period, was barely read in the twelfth century, while for Quintilian the reverse is true.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ziolkowski07-22&quot;/&gt;

===Renaissance===
The [[Renaissance]] led to the increasing study of both ancient literature and ancient history,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeller78-586&quot;/&gt; as well as a revival of classical styles of Latin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeller78-587&quot;/&gt; From the 14th century, first in Italy and then increasingly across Europe, [[Renaissance Humanism]], an intellectual movement that &quot;advocated the study and imitation of classical antiquity&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeller78-586&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=586}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed. Humanism saw a reform in education in Europe, introducing a wider range of Latin authors as well as bringing back the study of Greek language and literature to Western Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeller78-587&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=587}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reintroduction was initiated by Francesco Petrarca (1304-1374) and Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375) who commissioned a Calabrian scholar to translate the Homeric poems.&lt;ref&gt;Pade, M. (2007). The Reception of Plutarch's Lives in Fifteenth-Century Italy. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum&lt;/ref&gt; This humanist educational reform spread from Italy, in Catholic countries as it was adopted by the Jesuits, and in countries that became Protestant such as England, Germany, and the Low Countries, in order to ensure that future clerics were able to study the New Testament in the original language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeller 1978 590&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassicism===
The late 17th and 18th centuries are the period in Western European literary history which is most associated with the classical tradition, as writers consciously adapted classical models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaminski 2007 57&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical models were so highly prized that the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] were rewritten along neoclassical lines, and these &quot;improved&quot; versions were performed throughout the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning of the 18th century, the study of Greek became increasingly important relative to that of Latin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeller 1978 591&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kristeller|1978|p=591}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this period [[Johann Winckelmann]]'s claims for the superiority of the Greek visual arts influenced a shift in aesthetic judgements, while in the literary sphere, [[G.E. Lessing]] &quot;returned Homer to the centre of artistic achievement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaminski|2007|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, the study of Greek in schools began in the late-eighteenth century. The poet [[Walter Savage Landor]] claimed to have been one of the first English schoolboys to write in Greek during his time at [[Rugby School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
The nineteenth century saw the influence of the classical world, and the value of a classical education, decline,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|2001|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially in the US, where the subject was often criticised for its elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|2001|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the nineteenth century, little new literature was still being written in Latin – a practice which had continued as late as the eighteenth century – and a command of Latin declined in importance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeller 1978 590&quot;/&gt;  Correspondingly, classical education from the nineteenth century onwards began to increasingly de-emphasise the importance of the ability to write and speak Latin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kristeller 1978 591&quot;/&gt;  In the United Kingdom this process took longer than elsewhere.  Composition continued to be the dominant classical skill in England until the 1870s, when new areas within the discipline began to increase in popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stray 1996 81&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same decade came the first challenges to the requirement of Greek at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, though it would not be finally abolished for another fifty years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stray 1996 83&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the influence of classics as the dominant mode of education in Europe and North America was in decline in the nineteenth century, the discipline was rapidly evolving in the same period.  Classical scholarship was becoming more systematic and scientific, especially with the &quot;new philology&quot; created at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rommel 2001 169&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rommel|2001|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its scope was also broadening: it was during the nineteenth century that ancient history and classical archaeology began to be seen as part of Classics, rather than separate disciplines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stray 1996 81&quot;/&gt;

===20th century to present===
During the 20th century, the study of classics became less common. In England, for instance, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities stopped requiring students to have qualifications in Greek in 1920,&lt;ref name=&quot;Stray 1996 83&quot;/&gt; and in Latin at the end of the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stray 1996 85&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|1996|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] was introduced in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland in 1988, it did not mention the classics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stray 1996 85&quot;/&gt; By 2003, only about 10% of state schools in Britain offered any classical subjects to their students at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the study of classics has not declined as fast elsewhere in Europe. In 2009, a review of ''Meeting the Challenge'', a collection of conference papers about the teaching of Latin in Europe, noted that though there is opposition to the teaching of Latin in Italy, it is nonetheless still compulsory in most secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Balbo|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sub-disciplines==
One of the most notable characteristics of the modern study of Classics is the diversity of the field. Although traditionally focused on ancient Greece and Rome, the study now encompasses the entire ancient Mediterranean world{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, thus expanding the studies to Northern [[Africa]] as well as parts of the [[Middle East]].

===Philology&lt;!--'Classical philology' redirects here--&gt;===
{{further information|Philology}}
{{for|the journal|Classical Philology (journal)}}
[[File:Friedrich August Wolf - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black-and-white image of Freidrich August Wolf in profile|The eighteenth-century classicist Freidrich August Wolf was the author of ''Prolegomena to Homer'', one of the first great works of classical philology.]]
Philology is the study of language preserved in written sources; '''classical philology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is thus concerned with understanding any texts from the classical period written in the classical languages of Latin and Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The roots of classical philology lie in the renaissance, as humanist intellectuals attempted to return to the Latin of the classical period, especially of [[Cicero]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shorey|1906|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as scholars attempted to produce more accurate editions of ancient texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the principles of philology still used today developed during this period.  For instance, the observation that if a manuscript could be shown to be a copy of an earlier extant manuscript, then it provides no further evidence of the original text, was made as early as 1489 by [[Angelo Poliziano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=173&amp;ndash;4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other philological tools took longer to be developed: the first statement, for instance, of the principle that a more difficult reading should be preferred over a simpler one, was in 1697 by [[Jean Leclerc (theologian)|Jean Le Clerc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern discipline of classical philology began in Germany at the turn of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rommel 2001 169&quot;/&gt;  It was during this period that scientific principles of philology began to be put together into a coherent whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=174&amp;ndash;5}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to provide a set of rules by  which scholars could determine which manuscripts were most accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This &quot;new philology&quot;, as it was known, centred around the construction of a genealogy of manuscripts, with which a hypothetical common ancestor, closer to the original text than any existing manuscript, could be reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeology===
{{Main article|Classical archaeology}}
[[File:Lion Gate Mykene with Wilhelm Dörpfeld and Heinrich Schliemann.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Black and white photograph of the Lion Gate at Mycenae.|Schliemann and Dörpfeld's excavation at Mycenae was one of the earliest excavations in the field of classical archaeology.]]
Classical archaeology is the oldest branch of archaeology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its roots going back to [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann|J.J. Winckelmann's]] work on [[Herculaneum]] in the 1760s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renfrew80-288&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1980|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the last decades of the 19th century, however, that classical archaeology became part of the tradition of Western classical scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renfrew80-288&quot;/&gt; It was included as part of Cambridge University's [[Classical Tripos]] for the first time after the reforms of the 1880s, though it did not become part of Oxford's [[Literae Humaniores|Greats]] until much later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stray 1996 83&quot;/&gt;

The second half of the 19th century saw [[Heinrich Schliemann|Schliemann's]] excavations of [[Troy]] and [[Mycenae]]; the first excavations at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] and [[Delos]]; and [[Arthur Evans]]' work in Crete, particularly on [[Knossos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renfrew|1980|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period also saw the foundation of important archaeological associations (e.g. the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] in 1879),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many foreign archaeological institutes in Athens and Rome (the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]] in 1881, [[British School at Athens]] in 1886, [[American Academy in Rome]] in 1895, and [[British School at Rome]] in 1900).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stray|2010|pp=4&amp;ndash;5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, classical archaeology has taken little part in the theoretical changes{{clarify|date=May 2016}} in the rest of the discipline,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely ignoring the popularity of &quot;[[New Archaeology]]&quot; in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Archaeology is still criticized by traditional minded scholars of classical archaeology despite a wide acceptance of its basic techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darvil|first1=Timothy|title=New Archaeology|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/view/10.1093/acref/9780199534043.001.0001/acref-9780199534043-e-2752|website=Oxford Reference|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art history===
{{Main article|Art history}}
Some art historians focus their study on the development of art in the classical world. Indeed, the art and architecture of Ancient Rome and Greece is very well regarded and remains at the heart of much of our art today. For example, Ancient Greek architecture gave us the Classical Orders: [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]]. The [[Parthenon]] is still the architectural symbol of the classical world.

Greek sculpture is well known and we know the names of several Ancient Greek artists: for example, [[Phidias]].

===Ancient history===
With philology, archaeology, and art history, scholars seek understanding of the history and culture of a civilisation, through critical study of the extant literary and physical artefacts, in order to compose and establish a continual historic narrative of the Ancient World and its peoples. The task is difficult due to a dearth of physical evidence: for example, [[Sparta]] was a leading Greek [[city-state]], yet little evidence of it survives to study, and what is available comes from [[Athens]], Sparta's principal rival; likewise, the [[Roman Empire]] destroyed most evidence (cultural artefacts) of earlier, conquered civilizations, such as that of the [[Etruscans]].

===Philosophy===
{{Main article|Ancient philosophy}}
The English word &quot;philosophy&quot; comes from the Greek word φιλοσοφία, meaning &quot;love of wisdom&quot;, probably coined by Pythagoras.  Along with the word itself, the discipline of philosophy as we know it today has its roots in ancient Greek thought, and according to Martin West &quot;philosophy as we understand it is a Greek creation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|West|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancient philosophy was traditionally divided into three branches: logic, physics, and ethics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann 1996 178&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, not all of the works of ancient philosophers fit neatly into one of these three branches.  For instance, Aristotle's ''Rhetoric'' and ''Poetics'' have been traditionally classified in the West as &quot;ethics&quot;, but in the Arabic world were grouped with logic; in reality, they do not fit neatly into either category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann 1996 178&quot;/&gt;

From the last decade of the eighteenth century, scholars of ancient philosophy began to study the discipline historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, works on ancient philosophy had been unconcerned with chronological sequence and with reconstructing the reasoning of ancient thinkers; with what Wolfgang-Ranier Mann calls &quot;New Philosophy&quot;, this changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mann|1996|pp=180–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception studies===
{{main article|Classical reception studies}}
A relatively recent new discipline within the classics is &quot;reception studies&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bulwer|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which developed in the 1960s at the [[University of Konstanz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kallendorf07-02&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kallendorf|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reception studies is concerned with how students of classical texts have understood and interpreted them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kallendorf07-02&quot;/&gt;
As such, reception studies is interested in a two-way interaction between reader and text,&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale07-298&quot;/&gt; taking place within a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the idea of an &quot;aesthetics of reception&quot; was first put forward by [[Hans Robert Jauss]] in 1967, the principles of reception theory go back much earlier than this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale07-298&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As early as 1920, [[T.S. Eliot]] wrote that &quot;the past [is] altered by the present as much as the present is directed by the past&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eliot|1920|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Martindale describes this as a &quot;cardinal principle&quot; for many versions of modern reception theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martindale07-298&quot;/&gt;

==Classical Greece==
{{Main article|Ancient Greece|Outline of ancient Greece|Timeline of ancient Greece}}

Ancient Greece was the civilization belonging to the period of Greek history lasting from the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]], beginning in the eighth century BC, to the [[Roman conquest of Greece]] after the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|Battle of Corinth]] in 146 BC.  The [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], during the fifth and fourth centuries BC, has traditionally been considered the height of Greek civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Classical period of Greek history is generally considered to have begun with the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first]] and [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|second Persian invasions of Greece]] at the start of the Greco-Persian wars,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2007|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have ended with the death of [[Alexander the Great]].

Classical Greek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe; thus Classical Greece is generally considered to be the seminal culture which provided the foundation of Western civilization.

===Language===
[[File:AncientGreekDialects (Woodard) en.svg|right|thumb|alt=|Map showing the regional dialects of Greek during the Classical period]]
{{Main article|Ancient Greek|Mycenaean Greek language|Koine Greek}}

Ancient Greek is the historical stage in the development of the Greek language spanning the Archaic (c. 8th to 6th centuries BC), Classical (c. 5th to 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic (c. 3rd century BC to 6th century AD) periods of ancient Greece and the ancient world. It is predated in the 2nd millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek. Its Hellenistic phase is known as Koine (&quot;common&quot;) or Biblical Greek, and its late period mutates imperceptibly into Medieval Greek. Koine is regarded as a separate historical stage of its own, although in its earlier form it closely resembles Classical Greek. Prior to the Koine period, Greek of the classical and earlier periods included several regional dialects.

Ancient Greek was the language of Homer and of classical Athenian historians, playwrights, and philosophers. It has contributed many words to the vocabulary of English and many other European languages, and has been a standard subject of study in Western educational institutions since the Renaissance. Latinized forms of Ancient Greek roots are used in many of the scientific names of species and in other scientific terminology.

===Literature===
{{Main article|Ancient Greek literature}}
The earliest surviving works of Greek literature are [[epic poetry]].  [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' are the earliest to survive to us today, probably composed in the eighth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These early epics were oral compositions, created without the use of writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Around the same time that the Homeric epics were composed, the [[Greek alphabet]] was introduced; the earliest surviving inscriptions date from around 750 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk-45&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Kirk|1985|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Need to put something about archaic poetry here...
Some of the earliest Greek poetry to be composed in written form was that of [[Archilochus]], around a century after the introduction of the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk-45&quot;/&gt; --&gt;
European [[drama]] was invented in ancient Greece.  Traditionally this was attributed to [[Thespis]], around the middle of the sixth century BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the earliest surviving work of Greek drama is [[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'', which dates to 472 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;WIGEK-258&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Greek tragedy was performed by a chorus and two actors, but by the end of Aeschylus' life, a third actor had been introduced, either by him or by [[Sophocles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WIGEK-258&quot;/&gt;  The last surviving Greek tragedies are the ''[[Bacchae]]'' of [[Euripides]] and Sophocles' [[Oedipus at Colonus]], both from the end of the fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnington-Ingram|Gould|Easterling|Knox|1985|pp=339–340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surviving Greek comedy begins later than tragedy; the earliest surviving work, [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[Acharnians]]'', comes from 425 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handley-355&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Handley|1985|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, comedy dates back as early as 486 BC, when the [[Dionysia]] added a competition for comedy to the much earlier competition for tragedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handley-355&quot;/&gt;  The comedy of the fifth century is known as [[Old Comedy]], and it comes down to us solely in the eleven surviving plays of Aristophanes, along with a few fragments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Handley-355&quot;/&gt;  Sixty years after the end of Aristophanes' career, the next author of comedies to have any substantial body of work survive is [[Menander]], whose style is known as [[New Comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Handley|1985|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two historians flourished during Greece's classical age: Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus is commonly called the father of history, and his &quot;History&quot; contains the first truly literary use of prose in Western literature. Of the two, Thucydides was the more careful historian. His critical use of sources, inclusion of documents, and laborious research made his History of the Peloponnesian War a significant influence on later generations of historians.&lt;!-- Should talk about post-Thucydidean history: Xenophon, Polybius, Diodorus, Arrian, Plutarch etc. --&gt; The greatest achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy. There were many Greek philosophers, but three names tower above the rest: Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These have had a profound influence on Western society.&lt;!-- Socrates wrote nothing! What is he doing in this section?! --&gt;

===Mythology and religion===
{{Main article|Greek mythology|Religion in Ancient Greece}}

Greek mythology is the body of myths and legends belonging to the ancient Greeks concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. They were a part of religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to the myths and study them in an attempt to throw light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.

Greek religion encompassed the collection of beliefs and rituals practiced in ancient Greece in the form of both popular public religion and cult practices. These different groups varied enough for it to be possible to speak of Greek religions or &quot;cults&quot; in the plural, though most of them shared similarities. Also, the Greek religion extended out of Greece and out to neighbouring islands.

Many Greek people recognized the major gods and goddesses: Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Ares, Dionysus, Hephaestus, Athena, Hermes, Demeter, Hestia and Hera; though philosophies such as Stoicism and some forms of Platonism used language that seems to posit a transcendent single deity. Different cities often worshipped the same deities, sometimes with epithets that distinguished them and specified their local nature.

===Philosophy===
{{Main article|Ancient Greek philosophy}}
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A bust of Socrates|So influential was Socrates to classical philosophy that earlier philosophers are today known as [[pre-Socratics]].]]

The earliest surviving philosophy from ancient Greece dates back to the 6th century BC, when according to Aristotle [[Thales of Miletus]] was considered to have been the first Greek philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other influential pre-Socratic philosophers include [[Pythagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]].  The most famous and significant figures in classical Athenian philosophy, from the 5th to the 3rd centuries BC, are [[Socrates]], his student [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], who studied at [[Plato's Academy]] before founding his own school, known as the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]]. Later Greek schools of philosophy, including the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], [[Stoics]], and [[Epicureans]], continued to be influential after the Roman annexation of Greece, and into the post-Classical world.

Greek philosophy dealt with a wide variety of subjects, including political philosophy, [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], [[ontology]], and [[logic]], as well as disciplines which are not today thought of as part of philosophy, such as biology and rhetoric.

==Classical Rome==
{{Main article|Ancient Rome|Culture of Ancient Rome}}

===Language===
{{main article|Latin}}
[[File:Praeneste fibula.JPG|right|thumb|alt=Photograph of a gold brooch|The Praeneste fibula is believed to bear the oldest known Latin inscription.  The inscription means &quot;Manius made me for Numerius&quot;.]]
The language of ancient Rome was Latin, a member of the [[Italic languages|Italic family of languages]]. The earliest surviving inscription in Latin comes from the 7th century BC, on a [[Praeneste fibula|brooch from Palestrina]]. Latin from between this point and the early 1st century BC is known as [[Old Latin]]. Most surviving Latin literature is [[Classical Latin]], from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. Latin then evolved into [[Late Latin]], in use during the [[Late antiquity|late antique period]]. Late Latin survived long after the end of classical antiquity, and was finally replaced by written Romance languages around the 9th century AD. Along with literary forms of Latin, there existed various vernacular dialects, generally known as [[Vulgar Latin]], in use throughout antiquity. These are mainly preserved in sources such as graffiti and the [[Vindolanda tablets]].

===Literature===
{{main article|Latin literature}}
The earliest surviving Latin authors, writing in Old Latin, include the playwrights [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].  Much of the best known and most highly thought of Latin literature comes from the classical period, with poets such as [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]; historians such as [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Tacitus]]; orators such as [[Cicero]]; and philosophers such as [[Seneca the Younger]] and [[Lucretius]].  Late Latin authors include many Christian writers such as [[Lactantius]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Ambrose]]; non-Christian authors, such as the historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], are also preserved.

===History===
{{main article|Timeline of ancient Rome}}
According to legend, the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in reality, there had been a settlement on the site since around 1000 BC, when the [[Palatine Hill]] was settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was originally ruled by kings, first Roman, and then Etruscan &amp;ndash; according to Roman tradition, the first Etruscan king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus, ruled from 616 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=21&amp;ndash;22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the 6th century BC, the city expanded its influence over the entirety of [[Latium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the end of the 6th century &amp;ndash; traditionally in 510 BC &amp;ndash; the kings of Rome were driven out, and the city became a republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 387 BC, Rome was sacked by the Gauls following the [[Battle of the Allia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; It soon recovered from this humiliating defeat, however, and in 381 the inhabitants of [[Tusculum]] in Latium were made Roman citizens. This was the first time Roman citizenship was extended in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rome went on to expand its area of influence, until by 269 the entirety of the Italian peninsula was under Roman rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards, in 264, the [[First Punic War]] began; it lasted until 241.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=83&amp;ndash;85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Second Punic War]] began in 218, and by the end of that year, the Carthaginian general [[Hannibal]] had invaded Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The war saw Rome's worst defeat to that point at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]; the largest army Rome had yet put into the field was wiped out, and one of the two consuls leading it was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Rome continued to fight, annexing much of Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually defeating Carthage, ending her position as a major power and securing Roman preeminence in the Western Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1978|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Three more paragraphs probably needed: one on the late Republic and civil war, one on the early empire, and one on the later empire to the fall of the Western empire --&gt;

==Legacy of the classical world==
The classical languages of the Ancient Mediterranean world influenced every European language, imparting to each a learned vocabulary of international application. Thus, Latin grew from a highly developed cultural product of the Golden and Silver eras of Latin literature to become the ''international lingua franca'' in matters diplomatic, scientific, philosophic and religious, until the 17th century. Long before this, Latin had evolved into [[Romance languages|the Romance languages]] and Ancient Greek into [[Modern Greek]] and its [[Modern Greek dialects|dialects]]. In the specialised science and technology vocabularies, the influence of [[Latin influence in English|Latin]] and [[English words of Greek origin|Greek]] is notable. [[Ecclesiastical Latin]], the Roman Catholic Church's official language, remains a living legacy of the classical world in the contemporary world.

Latin had an impact far beyond the classical world.  It continued to be the pre-eminent language for serious writings in Europe long after the fall of the Roman empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|pp=xi–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[Romance languages]] – such as French, Spanish, and Italian – all derive from Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Latin is still seen as a foundational aspect of European culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of the classical world is not confined to the influence of classical languages.  The Roman empire was taken as a model by later European empires, such as the [[Spanish empire|Spanish]] and [[British empire|British]] empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ostler|2009|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical art has been taken as a model in later periods – medieval Romanesque architecture&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziolkowski|2007|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Enlightenment-era neoclassical literature&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaminski 2007 57&quot;/&gt; were both influenced by classical models, to take but two examples, while [[James Joyce|Joyce's]] ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' is one of the most influential works of twentieth century literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martindale|2007|p=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;
