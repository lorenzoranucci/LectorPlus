[[Sarajevo]] is the capital and largest city. Bordered by [[Croatia]] to the north, west, and south; [[Serbia]] to the east; [[Montenegro]] to the southeast; and the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the south, with a coastline about {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} long surrounding the city of [[Neum]]. In the central and eastern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], with hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and plain topography.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a region that traces permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has a rich history, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries AD. In the 12th century the [[Banate of Bosnia]] was established, which evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it would remain from the mid-15th to the late 19th centuries. The Ottomans brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], the country was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the country [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence of the Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until [[Dayton Agreement|late 1995]].

Today, the country maintains high [[List of countries by Human Development Index|literacy, life expectancy and education]] levels and is one of the [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|most frequently visited countries in the region]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bosnia-and-hercegovina |title=Lonely Planet's Bosnia and Herzegovina Tourism Profile |publisher=Lonely Planet |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; projected to have the third highest tourism growth rate in the world between 1995 and 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newfound&quot;&gt;[http://features.us.reuters.com/destinations/news/L20239376.html Bosnia's newfound tourism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224155630/http://features.us.reuters.com/destinations/news/L20239376.html |date=24 December 2007 }}, [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural beauty and [[Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cultural heritage]] inherited from six historical civilizations, its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine|cuisine]], [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina#Winter sports|winter sports]], its eclectic and unique [[Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina|music]], [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|architecture]] and its [[Sarajevo#Festivals|festivals]], some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sff.ba/content.php/en/festival?set_culture=en |title=About the Sarajevo Film Festival |publisher=Sarajevo Film Festival Official Website |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104133828/http://www.sff.ba/content.php/en/festival?set_culture=en |archivedate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidefilm.com/europe.html |title=Inside Film's Guide to Film Festivals in  |publisher=Inside Film  |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to three main ethnic groups or, officially, [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]], as specified in the constitution. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest group of the three, with [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] second and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] third. A native of Bosnia and Herzegovina, regardless of ethnicity, is identified in English as a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]]. The terms [[Herzegovinians|Herzegovinian]] and Bosnian are maintained as a regional rather than ethnic distinction, and the region of Herzegovina has no precisely defined borders of its own. Moreover, the country was simply called &quot;Bosnia&quot; until the Austro-Hungarian occupation at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/03/vinko.shtml |title=The Language Situation in Post-Dayton Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Toronto Slavic Quarterly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703180910/http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/03/vinko.shtml |archivedate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]], with a third region, the [[Brčko District]], governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is itself complex and consists of 10 federal units&amp;nbsp;– [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. The country is a [[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|potential candidate for membership to the European Union]] and has been a candidate for [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] membership since April 2010, when it received a [[Membership Action Plan]] at a summit in [[Tallinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Membership Action Plan (MAP) |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37356.htm |website=www.nato.int |publisher=NATO |accessdate=6 April 2015 |quote=In April 2010, NATO Foreign Ministers at their meeting in Tallinn, reviewed progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s reform efforts and invited the country to join the Membership Action Plan. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418174843/http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_37356.htm |archivedate=18 April 2015 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the country has been a member of the [[Council of Europe]] since April 2002 and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean|Mediterranean Union]] upon its establishment in July 2008.

==Etymology==
The first preserved widely acknowledged mention of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] is in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', a politico-geographical handbook written by the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] in the mid-10th century (between 948 and 952) describing the &quot;small land&quot; (χωρίον in [[Greek language|Greek]]) of &quot;Bosona&quot; (Βοσώνα).&lt;ref name=&quot;Moravcsik-153&quot;&gt;{{cite book |edition=Moravcsik, Gyula|author=Constantine VII ''Porphyrogenitus'' |authorlink=Constantine VII|year=1993|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies|title=[[De Administrando Imperio]]|location=Washington D.C.|pages=153–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is believed to have been derived from the [[hydronym]] of the river [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] coursing through the Bosnian heartland. According to philologist Anton Mayer the name ''Bosna'' could be derived from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] &quot;Bass-an-as&quot; which would be a diversion of the Proto-Indo-European root &quot;bos&quot; or &quot;bogh&quot;, meaning &quot;the running water&quot;.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} According to English medievalist [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]] the Slavic settlers in Bosnia &quot;adapted the Latin designation [...] Basante, to their own idiom by calling the stream Bosna and themselves ''Bosniaks'' [...]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= [[William Miller (historian)|William Miller]]|title=Essays on the Latin Orient|volume=|page=464|location= Cambridge|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=0wpEBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA464|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Herzegovina'' (&quot;herzog's [land]&quot;, from German word for &quot;duke&quot;){{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} originates from Bosnian magnate [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača|Stephen Vukčić Kosača]]'s title, &quot;Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast&quot; (1448).{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=578}} Hum, formerly [[Zahumlje]], was an early medieval principality that was conquered by the Bosnian Banate in the first half of the 14th century. The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (''Hersek'') within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] up until the formation of the short-lived [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] in the 1830s, which was remerged in the 1850s, after which the entity became commonly known as &quot;Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot;.

On initial proclamation of independence in 1992, the country's official name was the ''[[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'' but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the name was officially changed to ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.

==Geography==

The country's name comes from the two regions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], which have a very vaguely defined border between them. Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four-fifths of the entire country, while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the southern part of the country.

The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central [[Dinaric Alps]]. The northeastern parts reach into the [[Pannonian Plain]], while in the south it borders the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. The Dinaric Alps generally run in a southeast-northwest direction, and get higher towards the south. The highest point of the country is the peak of [[Maglić (mountain)|Maglić]] at {{convert|2,386|m|ft|1|abbr=off}}, on the Montenegrin border. Major mountains include [[Kozara]], [[Grmeč]], [[Vlašić (mountain)|Vlašić]], [[Čvrsnica Mountain|Čvrsnica]], [[Prenj]], [[Romanija]], [[Jahorina]], [[Bjelašnica Mountain|Bjelašnica]] and [[Treskavica]].

Overall, close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in the centre, east and west parts of Bosnia. Herzegovina has drier Mediterranean climate, with dominant [[karst]] topography. Northern Bosnia ([[Posavina]]) contains very fertile agricultural land along the River Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Pannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The country has only {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} of coastline,&lt;ref name=&quot;coastline&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Neum coastline&quot;&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/place/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina Bosnia-and-Herzegovina Neum britannica.com], ''britannica.com'', 9 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; around the town of [[Neum]] in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by international law, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[right of passage]] to the outer sea.

[[Sarajevo]] is the capital&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccbh.ba/public/down/USTAV_BOSNE_I_HERCEGOVINE_engl.pdf|title=Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and largest city.{{sfn|CIA}} Other major cities are [[Banja Luka]] in the northwest region known as [[Bosanska Krajina]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Tuzla]] in the northeast, [[Zenica]] and [[Doboj]] in the central part of Bosnia and [[Mostar]], the largest city in [[Herzegovina]].

There are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina:&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web |title=Watershed Management in Mountain Regions in Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0269e/A0269E05.pdf |publisher=FAO |page=113 |author=Izet Čengić, Azra Čabaravdić |accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Sava River|Sava]] is the largest river of the country, and forms its northern [[natural border]] with Croatia. It drains 76%&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; of the country's territory into the Danube and then the Black Sea. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore also a member of the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]] (ICPDR).
* The [[Una (Sava)|Una]], [[Sana River|Sana]] and [[Vrbas River|Vrbas]] are right tributaries of Sava river. They are located in the northwestern region of Bosanska Krajina.
* The [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river gave its name to the country, and is the longest river fully contained within it. It stretches through central Bosnia, from its source near [[Sarajevo]] to Sava in the north.
* The [[Drina]] flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, and for the most part it forms a natural border with Serbia.
* The [[Neretva]] is the major river of Herzegovina and the only major river that flows south, into the Adriatic Sea.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the Pannonian [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian [[deciduous|deciduous forests]].

{{main article|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia has been inhabited since at latest the [[Neolithic]] age. The earliest Neolithic population became known in the [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] as the [[Illyrians]]. [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations in the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC were also notable. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different people speaking distinct languages. Conflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&amp;nbsp;BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&amp;nbsp;9. It was precisely in modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; This was the Roman campaign against [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known as ''[[Bellum Batonianum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Norma.

The [[Early Slavs]] raided the Western Balkans, including Bosnia, in the sixth and early seventh century (amid the [[Migration Period]]), and were composed of small tribal units drawn from a single Slavic confederation known to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] as the ''[[Sclaveni]]'' (whilst the related ''[[Antes people|Antes]]'', roughly speaking, colonized the eastern portions of the Balkans).&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia University Press&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed|authors= Robert J.

Bosnia is first mentioned ''as a land (horion Bosona)'' in Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' in the mid 10th century, at the end of a chapter (Chap. 32) entitled &quot;Of the Serbs and the country in which they now dwell&quot;.{{sfn|Basic|2009|p=123}} This has been scholarly interpreted in several ways and used especially by the Serb national ideologists to prove Bosnia as originally a &quot;Serb&quot; land.

In time, Bosnia would come to form a unit under its own ruler calling himself Bosnian.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=53}} Bosnia, along with other territories, became part of [[Duklja]] in the 11th century, although it retained its own nobility and institutions.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=223}}

In the [[High Middle Ages]] political circumstance led to the area being contested between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century, Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as the [[Banate of Bosnia]] (under the rule of local ''[[Ban (title)|bans]]'').{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Paul Mojzes.

In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254. During this time the population was called ''[[Dobri Bošnjani]]'' (&quot;Good Bosnians&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0rIGA0rluO0C&amp;pg=PA71|title=''Bosnia and Hercegovina: A Tradition Betrayed''|author=Robert J.

Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the [[Šubić]] and [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromanić]] became ''Ban''. By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his ambitious nephew [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. By the year 1377, Bosnia was elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of Tvrtko as the first [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Bosnian King]] in Mile near [[Visoko during the Middle Ages|Visoko]] in the Bosnian heartland.&lt;ref name=Mile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&amp;lang=1&amp;action=view&amp;id=1341|title=Declared as national monument |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116053150/http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&amp;lang=1&amp;action=view&amp;id=1341 |archivedate=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=An&gt;Anđelić Pavao, Krunidbena i grobna crkva bosanskih vladara u Milima (Arnautovićima) kod Visokog.

Following his death in 1391 however, Bosnia fell into a long period of decline. The [[Ottoman Empire]] had already started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463 after its conquest by the Ottoman Empire.

The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and [[cultural landscape]]. The Ottomans allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity&amp;nbsp;— a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;&gt;Riedlmayer, Andras (1993). [http://www.kakarigi.net/manu/briefhis.htm A Brief History of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. The Bosnian Manuscript Ingathering Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Bosnia the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

The four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to lack of strong Christian church organizations and continuous rivalry between the Orthodox and Catholic churches, while the indigenous [[Bosnian Church]] disappeared altogether (ostensibly by conversion of its members to Islam). The Ottomans referred to them as ''kristianlar'' while the Orthodox and Catholics were called ''gebir'' or ''kafir'', meaning &quot;unbeliever&quot;.{{sfn|Velikonja|2003|pp=29–30}}  The Bosnian [[Franciscan]]s (and the Catholic population as a whole) were protected by official imperial decrees and in accordance and full extent of Ottoman laws, however in effect, these often merely affected arbitrary rule and behavior of powerful local elite.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

As the Ottoman Empire continued their rule in the [[Balkans]] ([[Rumelia]]), Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province, and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into regional centers of trade and [[urban culture]] and were then visited by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian architecture]] such as the country's first library in [[Sarajevo]], [[madrassa]]s, a school of [[Sufi philosophy]], and a [[clock tower]] (''Sahat Kula''), bridges such as the [[Stari Most]], the [[Tsar's Mosque]] and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque]].

Furthermore, several Bosnian Muslims played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and [[political history]] during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt; Bosnian recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] and [[Battle of Krbava field|Krbava field]], while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals such as [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]; generals such as [[Isa-Beg Isaković]], [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] and [[Hasan Predojević]] and [[Sarı Süleyman Paşa]]; administrators such as [[Ferhat-paša Sokolović]] and [[Osman Gradaščević]]; and [[Vizier|Grand Viziers]] such as the influential [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović]] and [[Damad Ibrahim Pasha]]. Some Bosnians emerged as [[Sufi]] mystics, scholars such as [[Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi Bosnevi]], [[Ali Džabič]]; and poets in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic]], and [[Persian language]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamović, Mustafa 1996&quot;&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996).

[[File:Sarajevo 1878..jpg|thumb|right|220px|Bosniak resistance against the [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian military intervention]] in 1878]] 
However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the conclusion of the [[Great Turkish War]] with the [[treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 once again made Bosnia the Empire's westernmost province. The following century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague. The Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms.

This, combined with frustrations over territorial, political concessions in the north-east, and the plight of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Muslim]] refugees arriving from the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] into [[Bosnia Eyalet]], culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]], who endorsed a multicultural [[Bosnia Eyalet]] autonomous from the authoritarian rule of the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]], who persecuted, executed and abolished the [[Janissaries]] and reduced the role of autonomous [[Pasha]]s in [[Rumelia]]. Mahmud II sent his [[Grand Vizier]] to subdue Bosnia Eyalet and succeeded only with the reluctant assistance of [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamović, Mustafa 1996&quot;/&gt; Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate. Later agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation which eventually led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to [[Salonika]] that &quot;would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence.&quot;{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=19}} &quot;High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired [an...] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective.&quot;{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=33}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
On 28 September 1878, the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, backed by the [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Albert]], were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution with his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion lost 179 to 95. The gravest accusations were raised by the opposition rank and file against Andrassy.{{sfn|Albertini|1952|p=33}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although an Austro-Hungarian side quickly came to an agreement with Bosnians, tensions remained in certain parts of the country (particularly the south) and a mass emigration of predominantly Slavic dissidents occurred.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a &quot;model colony&quot;.
 [[File:Sarajevo Tram (1901).png|thumb|right|220px|[[Sarajevo Tramway]] in 1901]]
With the aim of establishing the province as a stable [[political spectrum|political model]] that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism, Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and to provide for modernisation. The Austro-Hungarian Empire built the three Roman Catholic churches in Sarajevo and these three churches are among only 20 Catholic churches in the state of Bosnia.{{Dubious|date=August 2014}}

In 1881, within three years of formal occupation of Bosnia Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary obtained German and the more important Russian approval of the annexation of these provinces at a time that suited Vienna. This mandate was formally ratified by the [[League of the Three Emperors|Dreikaiserbund (Three Emperor's Treaty)]] on 18 June of that year.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=37}} Upon the accession of Czar Nicholas II, however, the Russians reneged on the agreement, asserting in 1897 the need for special scrutiny of the Bosnian Annexation issue at an unspecified future date.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=94}}

External matters began to affect the Bosnian Protectorate, however, and its relationship with Austria-Hungary. A bloody coup occurred in Serbia, on 10 June 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in Belgrade.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=140}} Also, the revolt in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, raised concerns that the Istanbul government might seek the outright return of Bosnia Herzegovina. These factors caused the Austrian-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question sooner, rather than later.
 [[File:National Museum of BiH Aerial.JPG|thumb|left|220px|[[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was established in 1888]] 
On 2 July 1908, in response to the pressing of the Austrian-Hungarian claim, the Russian Imperial Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky offered to support the Bosnian annexation in return for Vienna's support for Russia's bid for naval access through the [[Dardanelles]] Straits into the Mediterranean.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=195}} With the Russians being, at least, provisionally willing to keep their word over Bosnia Herzegovina for the first time in 11 years, Austria-Hungary waited and then published the annexation proclamation on 6 October 1908. The international furor over the annexation announcement caused Izvolsky to drop the Dardanelles Straits question, altogether, in an effort to obtain a European conference over the Bosnian Annexation.{{sfn|Albertini|2005|p=227}} This conference never materialized and without British or French support, the Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909.

Political tensions culminated on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb nationalist youth named [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of the secret Serbian-supported movement, [[Young Bosnia]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in Sarajevo—an event that proved to be the spark that set off World War I.

{{main article|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1918–1941)}}
Following World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over [[redistribution (economics)|property redistribution]], and formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt; The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major [[ethnic group]]s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslavian kingdom saw few benefits for the Bosniaks; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in Austro-Hungary, Muslims (Bosniaks) owned 91.1%, Orthodox Serbians owned 6.0%, Croatian Catholics owned 2.6% and others, 0.3% of the property. Following the reforms Bosnian Muslims had a total of 1,175,305 hectares of agricultural and forest land taken away from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj, dnadj@hic.hr |url=http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm |title=An International Symposium &quot;Southeastern Europe 1918–1995&quot; |publisher=Hic.hr |accessdate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as [[Mehmed Spaho]] ensured that the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Subdivisions|banates]] or ''[[banovina (region)|banovinas]]'' that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration.

The [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|Cvetković-Maček Agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of Croatia|Croatian banate]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a [[partition of Bosnia]] between Croatia and Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamović, Mustafa 1996&quot;/&gt; However the rising threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]] forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention. Following a period that saw attempts at [[appeasement]], the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact|Tripartite Treaty]], and a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]], Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

On 12 October 1941, a group of 108 notable Muslim citizens of Sarajevo signed the [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] by which they condemned the persecution of Serbs organized by the [[Ustaše]], made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and whole Muslim population, presented information about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hadžijahić |first=Muhamed |title=Istorija Naroda Bosne i Hercegovine |year=1973 |publisher=Institut za istoriju radničkog pokreta |location=Sarajevo|language=Serbo-Croatian|page=277 |chapter=Muslimanske rezolucije iz 1941 godine [Muslim resolutions of 1941] |chapterurl=http://www.scribd.com/doc/47323922/Muhamed-Hadzijahic-Muslimanske-rezolucije-1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]] organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]], who fought against both Axis and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943 the [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Habsburg borders.

Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans, but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead. All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its peoples bore the brunt of fighting. More than 300,000 people died in Bosnia and Herzegovina in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Žerjavić|first=Vladimir|title=Yugoslavia manipulations with the number Second World War victims|publisher=Croatian Information Centre|isbn=0-919817-32-7|url=http://www.hic.hr/books/manipulations/index.htm|accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war the establishment of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], with the [[1946 Yugoslav Constitution|constitution of 1946]], officially made Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

Due to its central geographic position within the Yugoslavian federation, post-war Bosnia was selected as a base for the development of the [[Defense (military)|military defense]] industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in [[Bosnian War|the war that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}} However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was a peaceful and very prosperous country, with high employment, a strong industrial and export oriented economy, good education system and social and medical security for every citizen of S. R. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Several international corporations operated in Bosnia— [[Volkswagen]] (car factory in Sarajevo, from 1972), [[Coca Cola]] (from 1975), SKF Sweden (from 1967), Marlboro, (a tobacco factory in Sarajevo), and [[Holiday Inn]] hotels.  Sarajevo was the site of the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].

During the 1950s and 1960s Bosnia was a political backwater of the Republic of Yugoslavia.  In the 1970s a strong Bosnian political elite arose, fueled in part by Tito's leadership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia's [[diplomatic corps]]. While working within the Socialist system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stojic&quot;&gt;Stojic, Mile (2005).

[[BH Dani]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic did not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time. With the fall of the Soviet Union and the start of the break-up of Yugoslavia, doctrine of tolerance began to lose its potency, creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

On 18 November 1990, the first multi-party parliamentary elections were held. A second round followed on 25 November, resulting in a [[National Assembly|national assembly]] where communist power was replaced by a [[coalition]] of three ethnically based parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;phron1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |title=The Balkans: A post-Communist History |format=PDF |accessdate=14 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701210204/http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |archivedate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]'s subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]] (overwhelmingly favored among Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored among Bosniaks and Croats).

The [[Serbs|Serb]] members of parliament, consisting mainly of the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska|Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990. This Assembly established the [[Republika Srpska|Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 9 January 1992, which became [[Republika Srpska]] in August 1992.

On 18 November 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the ruling party in the Republic of Croatia, the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), proclaimed the existence of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]], as a separate &quot;political, cultural, economic, and territorial whole&quot;, on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the [[Croatian Defence Council|Croat Defence Council]] (HVO) as its military part.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Prlić et al.

A declaration of the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 15 October 1991, was followed by a referendum for independence from [[Yugoslavia]] on 29 February, and 1 March 1992 which was boycotted by the great majority of the Serbs. The turnout in the independence referendum was 63.4 percent and 99.7 percent of voters voted for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csce.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=UserGroups.Home&amp;ContentRecord_id=250&amp;ContentType=G&amp;ContentRecordType=G&amp;UserGroup_id=5&amp;Subaction=ByDate |title=The Referendum on Independence in Bosnia-Herzegovina: February 29&amp;nbsp;– March 1, 1992 |year=1992 |publisher=Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe |page=19 |accessdate=28 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence on 3 March 1992 and received international recognition the following month on 6 April 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contested lands: Israel-Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia, Cyprus, and Sri Lanka|first=Sumantra|last=Bose|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KKZcgOJPjVkC&amp;pg=PA124|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was subsequently admitted as a member State of the United Nations on 22 May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Admission to the United Nations: Charter Article 4 and the Rise of Universal Organization|first=Thomas|last=D.

In the meantime, following a period of escalating tensions, the opening shots in the incipient Bosnian conflict were fired when Serb paramilitary forces attacked Bosnian Croat villages around Capljina on 7 March 1992, and Bosanski Brod and the Bosniak-majority town, Gorazde, on 15 March. These minor attacks were followed by much more serious Serb artillery attacks on Neum on 19 March, and on Bosanski Brod on 24 March. It is disputed between Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs who the first casualties of the war were. Bosniaks regard the attack on the peace rally that was organized in Sarajevo on 5 April 1992, as marking the start of warfare between the three major communities. As the largest section of demonstrators moved towards the parliament building, Serb forces opened fire on the crowd from across the &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; hotel, killing two women, [[Suada Dilberović]], a Bosniak, and [[Olga Sučić]], a Croat.&lt;ref name=&quot;phron1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Debating the End of Yugoslavia|editor=Florian Bieber|year=2014|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eyzjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52|publisher=Ashgate Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ACvJHam2_-oC&amp;pg=PA284 |title = Sarajevo: A biography |isbn = 978-0-472-11557-0 |author1 = Donia |first1 = Robert J |date = 2006 |ref = harv|page = 284;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Samuel Totten|author2=Paul Robert Bartrop|title=Dictionary of genocide: A-L|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34642-2|pages=189–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vrbanja bridge]] where they perished has since then been renamed in their honour.

Discussions between [[Franjo Tuđman]] and [[Slobodan Milošević]] at the March 1991 [[Karađorđevo meeting]] are believed to have involved a plan to [[partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina|divide Bosnia and Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2004|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-271-01629-9|page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the declaration of independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs attacked different parts of the country. The state administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively ceased to function having lost control over the entire territory. The Serbs wanted control of large parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Milošević was widely accused of being the mastermind of a plan to build a &quot;[[Greater Serbia]]&quot;, the [[RAM Plan]]. At the same time, the policies of the Republic of Croatia and its leader Franjo Tuđman towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were never totally transparent and always included Franjo Tuđman's ultimate aim of expanding Croatia's borders. Bosnian Muslims were an easy target, because the Bosnian government forces were poorly equipped and unprepared for the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Naletilić and Martinović verdict&amp;nbsp;— A.

International recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased diplomatic pressure for the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) to withdraw from the republic's territory which they officially did. However, in fact, the Bosnian Serb members of JNA simply changed insignia, formed the Army of Republika Srpska, and continued fighting. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia, supported by volunteers and various [[paramilitary|paramilitary forces]] from Serbia, and receiving extensive humanitarian, logistical and financial support from the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], Republika Srpska's offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control.{{sfn|Malcolm|2002}}

Initially, the Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in Eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces—military, police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers—applied the same pattern: Bosniak houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. 2.2 million refugees were displaced by the end of the war (of all three nationalities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0c58.pdf|title=The humanitarian operation in Bosnia, 1992–95: the dilemmas of negotiating humanitarian access |date=May 1999 |publisher=United Nations High Commission for Refugees |accessdate=24 June 2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Able-bodied men were separated from their families and interned in camps under a brutal regimen of abuse, murder, and sporadic group executions, whereas women and children were kept in unsanitary detention centers, deprived of food and water. Rape by Serb soldiers or policemen was commonplace at the detention centers, and victims included women and minors as young as 12 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement&amp;nbsp;— Foča&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC |title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219012918/http://un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC |archivedate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though on a significantly smaller scale, war crimes would later also be committed by Bosniaks and Croats as their military campaigns gained momentum, including the establishment of prison camps in which torture, murder and rape took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/celebici/trialc2/judgement/index.htm |title=Judgement |publisher=UN |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=13 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016042438/http://www.un.org/icty/celebici/trialc2/judgement/index.htm |archivedate=16 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/p561-e.htm |title=Press Release |publisher=UN |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=7 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324044908/http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/p561-e.htm |archivedate=24 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;haverford&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/stolac/CrimesSt.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109091102/http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/stolac/CrimesSt.pdf |archivedate=9 January 2009 |title=Crimes in Stolac Municipality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/prl-ii040304e.htm |title=Indictment |publisher=UN |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=7 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212165106/http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/prl-ii040304e.htm |archivedate=12 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1992, the focus switched to [[Novi Travnik]] and [[Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje|Gornji Vakuf]] where the Croat Defence Council (HVO) efforts to gain control were resisted. On 18 June 1992, the Bosnian Territorial Defence in Novi Travnik received an [[ultimatum]] from the HVO which included demands to abolish existing Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions, establish the authority of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and pledge allegiance to it, subordinate the Territorial Defense to the HVO and expel Muslim refugees, all within 24 hours. The attack was launched on 19 June. The elementary school and the [[Post office|Post Office]] were attacked and damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=ICTY |title=Kordic and Cerkez judgment&amp;nbsp;– II.

Gornji Vakuf was initially attacked by Croats on 20 June 1992, but the attack failed. The [[Graz agreement]] caused deep division inside the Croat community and strengthened the separation group, which led to the conflict with Bosniaks. One of the primary pro-union Croat leaders, [[Blaž Kraljević]] (leader of the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS) armed group) was killed by HVO soldiers in August 1992, which severely weakened the moderate group who hoped to keep the Bosnian Croat alliance alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Sarajevo, i poslije'', Erich Rathfelder, [[Munich|München]] 1998 [http://www.hsp1861.hr/vijesti/201129erra.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation became more serious in October 1992, when Croat forces attacked the Bosniak population in [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]]. According to ''[[Jadranko Prlić]] indictment'', HVO forces cleansed most of the Muslims from the town of Prozor and several surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Prlić et al. (IT-04-74)&quot;/&gt;

By 1993, when an armed conflict erupted between the predominantly Bosniak government in Sarajevo and the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, about 70% of the country was controlled by Republika Srpska. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] violations against non-Serbs were rampant in these areas.

[[File:Bk-map.png|thumb|220px|left|Bosnia and Herzegovina after the [[Dayton Agreement]] ]]
In March 1994, the signing of the Washington Accords between the leaders of the republican government and Herzeg-Bosnia led to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which absorbed the territory of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and that held by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation soon liberated the small [[Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia]].

Following the [[Srebrenica genocide]], a [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|NATO bombing campaign]] began in August 1995, against the Army of Republika Srpska. Meanwhile, a ground offensive by the allied forces of Croatia and Bosnia, based on the [[Split Agreement]] signed by Tudjman and Izetbegović, pushed the Serbs away from territories held in western Bosnia which paved the way to negotiations. In December 1995, the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Alija Izetbegović]]), Croatia ([[Franjo Tuđman]]) and Serbia ([[Slobodan Milošević]]) brought a halt to the fighting, roughly establishing the basic structure of the present-day state. A [[IFOR|NATO-led peacekeeping force]] was immediately dispatched to Bosnia to enforce the agreement.

The number of identified victims is currently at 97,207 (civilian and military casualties). These include 64,341 Bosniaks, 24,726 Serbs, and 7,602 Croats.&lt;ref name=&quot;idc.org.ba&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idc.org.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=126&amp;lang=bs|title=Research and Documentation Center: Rezultati istraživanja &quot;Ljudski gubici '91–'95&quot;|author=|date=|work=idc.org.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research estimates the total number to be no more than 110,000 killed (civilians and military),&lt;ref name=&quot;hundred thousand&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/eujp/2005/00000021/F0020002/00006852 |publisher=European Journal of Population |title=War-related Deaths in the 1992–1995 Armed Conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A Critique of Previous Estimates and Recent Results |date=June 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906063642/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/eujp/2005/00000021/F0020002/00006852 |archivedate=6 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hundredthousand&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=L23677389 |agency=Reuters |title=Research halves Bosnia war death toll to 100,000 |date=23 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522111634/http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=L23677389 |archivedate=22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hundredthousandplus&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/March/20060302182114MVyelwarC0.6359674.html |publisher=U.S. Department of State |title=Review of European Security Issues |date=3 March 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021004643/http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/March/20060302182114MVyelwarC0.6359674.html |archivedate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.8 million displaced.

At the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), the Bosnian government charged Serbia of complicity in [[genocide]] in Bosnia during the war. The ICJ ruling of 26 February 2007, effectively determined the war's nature to be international, though exonerating Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by Serb forces of [[Republika Srpska]]. The ICJ concluded, however, that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces and failed to punish those who carried out the genocide&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;in particular, General [[Ratko Mladić]]&amp;nbsp;– and bring them to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13685.pdf|title=ICJ: The genocide case: Bosnia v. Serbia |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mladić was arrested in a village in northern Serbia on 26 May 2011 and, among other genocide and [[war crime]] charges, accused of directly orchestrating and overseeing the slaughter of 8,000 Bosniak men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profile: Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb army chief |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13559597 |publisher=BBC NEWS Europe |date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bosnian social protests Tuzla.jpg|220p|thumbnail|right|Tuzla government building burning after anti-government clashes on 7 February 2014]]
On 4 February 2014, the protests against the government of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], one of the country's two entities, dubbed the '''Bosnian Spring''', the name being taken from the [[Arab Spring]], began in the northern town of [[Tuzla]]. Workers from several factories which were privatised and which have now gone bankrupt united to demand action over jobs, unpaid salaries and pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26093160|title=Bosnian protests: A Balkan Spring?|date=8 February 2014|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon protests spread to the rest of the Federation, with violent clashes reported in close to 20 towns, the biggest of which were [[Sarajevo]], [[Zenica]], [[Mostar]], [[Bihać]], [[Brčko]] and Tuzla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/gradjanski-bunt |title=Građanski bunt u BiH |date=8 February 2014 |work=klix.ba |accessdate=8 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207102210/http://www.klix.ba/gradjanski-bunt |archivedate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bosnian news media reported that hundreds of people had been injured during the protests, including dozens of police officers, with bursts of violence in Sarajevo, in the northern city of Tuzla, in Mostar in the south, and in Zenica in central Bosnia. The same level of unrest or activism did not occur in the [[Republika Srpska]], but hundreds of people also gathered in support of protests in the town of [[Banja Luka]] against its separate government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/world/europe/protests-over-government-and-economy-roil-bosnia.html?_r=0|title=Protests Over Government and Economy Roil Bosnia|date=8 February 2014|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=8 February 2014|first=Dan|last=Bilefsky}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rferl.org/content/bosnia-demonstrations-tuzla-clashes/25256653.html|title=Bosnian Protesters Torch Government Buildings In Sarajevo, Tuzla|date=8 February 2014|work=rferl.org|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26086857|title=Bosnia-Hercegovina protests break out in violence|date=8 February 2014|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests marked the largest outbreak of public anger over high unemployment and two decades of political inertia in the country since the end of the Bosnian War in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/world/bosnian-protesters-storm-government-buildings-20140208-hvbn6.html|title=Bosnian protesters storm government buildings|date=8 February 2014|work=smh.com.au|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
{{main article|Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Map Bih entities.png|thumb|220px|right|Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (FBiH); [[Republika Srpska]] (RS); and [[Brčko District]] (BD).]]

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a [[liberal democracy]]. It has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton accord]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996, the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves. The [[Brčko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000, out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Brčko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Brčko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHR&quot;&gt;OHR Bulletin 66 (3 February 1998).

}}

The third level of Bosnia and Herzegovina's political subdivision is manifested in [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. All of them have their own cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws implemented to ensure the equality of all constituent people.

The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipalities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided in 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska in 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.

Besides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four &quot;official&quot; cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Istočno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).

As a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state.

The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.

The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.

The Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of [[proportional representation]] (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.

The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.

However, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |title='The Contradictions of &quot;Democracy&quot; without Consent', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517144513/http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html |archivedate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.

===Military===
[[File:TRE32 HMVE.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Bosnian Humvee's and several APC's take a training route at a practice drill 2016.]]
The [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] was founded in 2004.

The Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 14,725 active and 7,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces have 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPAD]] hand-held missiles, [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. The Army has recently adopted remodeled [[MARPAT]] uniforms, used by Bosnian soldiers serving with [[ISAF]] in [[Afghanistan]]. A domestic production program is now underway to ensure that army units are equipped with the correct ammunition.

Beginning in 2007, the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] undertook the army's first ever international assistance mission, enlisting the military to serve with [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] peace missions to [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2007. Five officers, acting as officers/advisors, served in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. 45 soldiers, mostly acting as base security and medical assistants, served in [[Afghanistan]]. 85 Bosnian soldiers served as base security in [[Iraq]], occasionally conducting infantry patrols there as well. All three deployed groups have been commended by their respective international forces as well as the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The international assistance operations are still ongoing.

The Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence Brigade of Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed when elements of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Republika Srpska Air Force]] were merged in 2006. The [[Air Force]] has seen improvements in the last few years with added funds for aircraft repairs and improved cooperation with the [[Ground Forces]] as well as to the citizens of the country.  The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] is currently pursuing the acquisition of new aircraft including helicopters and perhaps even fighter jets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/bosnia-breaks-through-ethnic-divide-by-merging-serb-muslim-croat-forces-1.43446|title=Bosnia breaks through ethnic divide by merging Serb, Muslim-Croat forces|publisher=Stars and Stripes|date=11 January 2006|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===
{{main article|Foreign relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union}}
[[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|EU integration]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it initiated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] in 2007. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, Member States of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm |title=European Commission&amp;nbsp;– Enlargement&amp;nbsp;– Bosnia and Herzegovina&amp;nbsp;– Relations with the EU |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=3 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, relations with its neighbors of [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] have been fairly stable since the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995.

On 23 April 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina received the [[Membership Action Plan]] from [[NATO]], which is the last step before full membership in the alliance. Full membership was expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.

They are also a member of the [[Group of 77]].

The equal status of Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian was verified by the Constitutional Court in 2000.&lt;ref name=Footitt/&gt; It ruled that the provisions of the Federation and Republika Srpska constitutions on language were incompatible with the state constitution, since they only recognised &quot;Bosniak&quot; and Croatian (in the case of the Federation) and Serbian (in the case of Republika Srpska) as official languages at the entity level. As a result, the wording of the entity constitutions was changed and all three languages were made official in both entities.&lt;ref name=Footitt/&gt; The three languages are [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] and were previously known collectively as [[Serbo-Croatian]]. Use of one of the three languages has become a marker of ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Identity in the Balkans: Serbo-Croatian and its Disintegration|last=Greenberg|first=Robert David|year=2004|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925815-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Kelly and Catherine Baker argue: &quot;The three official languages of today's Bosnian state...represent the symbolic assertion of national identity over the pragmatism of mutual intelligibility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Interpreting the Peace: Peace Operations, Conflict and Language in Bosnia-Herzegovina|first1=Michael|last1=Kelly|first2=Catherine|last2=Baker|location=Basingstoke|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2013|page=10|isbn=1137029838}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1992 [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], Bosnia and Herzegovina recognizes the following minority languages: [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[German language|German]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Rysin]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and Jewish ([[Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;charter-ratifications&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/Commun/ListeDeclarations.asp?NT=148&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG&amp;VL=1|title=Recherches sur les traités|work=Bureau des Traités}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mostly remnants of [[Donauschwaben]] (Danube Swabians), who settled in the area after the [[Austrian Empire|Habsburg monarchy]] claimed the Balkans from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Due to [[Flight and expulsion of Germans|expulsions]] and [[Organised persecution of ethnic Germans|(forced) assimilation]] after the two [[World War]]s, the number of ethnic Germans in Bosnia and Herzegovina was drastically diminshed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agdm.fuen.org/mitglied-102/bosnia-and-herzegovina/ |title=Deutsche Minderheit in Bosnien-Herzegowina – German minority in Bosnia and Herzegovina |author=Arbeitsgemeinschaft Deutscher Minderheiten |work=fuen.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925092959/http://agdm.fuen.org/mitglied-102/bosnia-and-herzegovina/ |archivedate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia faces the dual-problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing transitional liberal market reforms to its formerly mixed economy. One legacy of the previous era is a strong industry; under former republic president [[Džemal Bijedić]] and SFRY President [[Josip Broz Tito]], metal industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's plants; S.R. Bosnia and Herzegovina had a very strong industrial export oriented economy in the 1970s and 1980s, with large scale exports worth millions of [[US$]].

For most of Bosnia's history, agriculture has been conducted on privately owned farms; Fresh food has traditionally been exported from the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/225/t225-4.htm |title=A Divided Bosnia, January 29, 1996 |author=Aleksandar Ciric |accessdate=2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war in the 1990s, caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy.&lt;ref&gt;Daclon, Corrado Maria (1997). Bosnia. Maggioli. Italy&lt;/ref&gt; GDP fell by 60% and the destruction of physical infrastructure devastated the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/skills/training/publ/pub12.htm |title=Post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina&amp;nbsp;– Martha Walsh&amp;nbsp;– Employment Sector |publisher=ILO |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; With much of the production capacity unrestored, the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties. Figures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004; this and Bosnia's shrinking [[Government debt|national debt]] being negative trends, and high unemployment 38.7% and a large [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]] remain cause for concern.

The national currency is the (Euro-pegged) [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark|Convertible Mark]] (KM), controlled by the [[currency board]]. Annual inflation is the lowest relative to other countries in the region at 1.9% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|title=[[The World Factbook|World Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international debt was $5.1&amp;nbsp;billion (as on 31 December 2014)&amp;nbsp;. [[Gross domestic product|Real GDP]] growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Central Bank of BiH]] and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has displayed positive progress in the previous years, which decisively moved its place from the lowest income equality rank of [[List of countries by income equality|income equality rankings]] fourteen out of 193 nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/HDR06-complete.pdf#page=335 |title=Table 15: Inequality in income or expenditure |accessdate=9 January 2007 |publisher=UN |year=2006 |format=PDF |work=Human Development Report 2006|page=335 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206223646/http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/HDR06-complete.pdf#page=335 |archivedate=6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Bosnia and Herzegovina's PPS GDP per capita stood at 29 per cent of the EU average in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114 |title=GDP per capita in PPS |publisher=Eurostat |accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) announced a loan to Bosnia worth US$500 million to be delivered by [[IMF Stand-By Arrangement|Stand-By Arrangement]]. This was scheduled to be approved in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elvira M.

[[File:University.JPG|thumb|right|The University of [[Bijeljina]]  ]]

Higher education has a long and rich tradition in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first bespoke higher-education institution was a school of [[Sufism|Sufi]] philosophy established by [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] in 1531. Numerous other religious schools then followed. In 1887, under the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a [[Sharia]] law school began a five-year program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sarajevo.ba/en/stream.php?kat=145 University of Sarajevo] on Sarajevo official web site&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1940s the [[University of Sarajevo]] became the city's first secular higher education institute. In the 1950s post-bachelaurate graduate degrees became available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unsa.ba/eng/ouni.php |publisher=University of Sarajevo |title=About University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204110445/http://www.unsa.ba/eng/ouni.php |archivedate=4 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severely damaged during the war, it was recently rebuilt in partnership with more than 40 other universities. There are various other institutions of higher education, including: [[University &quot;Džemal Bijedić&quot; of Mostar]], [[University of Banja Luka]], [[University of Mostar]], [[University of East Sarajevo]], [[University of Tuzla]], [[American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which is held in high regard as one of the most prestigious creative arts academies in the region.

Also, Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to several private and international higher education institutions, some of which are:

* [[Sarajevo School of Science and Technology]]
* [[International University of Sarajevo]]
* [[American University in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
* [[Sarajevo Graduate School of Business]]
* [[International Burch University]]

Primary schooling lasts for nine years. Secondary education is provided by general and technical secondary schools (typically [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasiums]]) where studies typically last for four years. All forms of secondary schooling include an element of [[vocational education|vocational training]]. Pupils graduating from general secondary schools obtain the [[Matura]] and can enroll in any tertiary educational institution or academy by passing a qualification examination prescribed by the governing body or institution. Students graduating technical subjects obtain a [[Diploma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euroeducation.net/prof/boherco.htm |title=Education System in Bosnia and Herzegovina |website=EuroEducation.net – The European Education Directory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

===Architecture===
{{main article|Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely influenced by four major periods where political and social changes influenced the creation of distinct cultural and architectural habits of the population. Each period made its influence felt and contributed to a greater diversity of cultures and architectural language in this region.

=== Media ===
{{Main article|Media of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Television, magazines, and newspapers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on [[advertising]], [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]].

As a [[country in transition]] with a post-war legacy and a [[politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|complex domestic political structure]] Bosnia and Herzegovina's media system is under transformation. In the early post-war period (1995–2005), media development was guided mainly by international donors and cooperation agencies, who invested to help reconstruct, diversify, democratize and professionalize media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;Hozić, 2008; Thompson &amp; De Luce, 2002; Kurspahić, 2003; Jusić, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EJC&gt;Tarik Jusić, &quot;[http://ejc.net/media_landscapes/bosnia-and-herzegovina Bosnia and Herzegovina]&quot;, EJC Media Landscapes&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war developments included the establishment of an independent Communication Regulatory Agency, the adoption of a Press Code, the establishment of the Press Council, the decriminalization of label and defamation, the introduction of a rather advanced Freedom of Access to Information Law, and the creation of a Public Service Broadcasting System from the formerly state-owned broadcaster.
Yet, internationally backed positive developments have been often obstructed by domestic elites, and the professionalisation of media and journalists has proceeded only slowly. High levels of partisanship and linkages between the media and the political systems hinder the adherence to professional code of conducts.&lt;ref name=EJC/&gt;

===Literature===
{{main article|Literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literature, including the [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Ivo Andrić]] and poets such as Croat [[Antun Branko Šimić]], [[Aleksa Šantić]], [[Jovan Dučić]] and [[Mak Dizdar]], writers such as [[Meša Selimović]], [[Zlatko Topčić]], [[Semezdin Mehmedinović]], [[Miljenko Jergović]], [[Isak Samokovlija]], [[Safvet beg Bašagić]], [[Abdulah Sidran]], [[Petar Kočić]], [[Aleksandar Hemon]], and Nedžad Ibrišimović. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was the dramatist [[Branislav Nušić]].
Magazines such as ''[[Novi Plamen]]'' or ''[http://sveske.ba/en Sarajevske sveske]'' are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.

===Art===
[[File:Bosniangraves bosniska gravar februari 2007 stecak stecci5.jpg|upright|218px|thumb|Stećci from Radimlja, near [[Stolac]] (13th century)]]
{{main article|Art of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Stećci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], [[Petar Šain]], [[Roman Petrović]] and [[Lazar Drljača]].

After World War II artists like [[Mersad Berber]] and [[Safet Zec]] rose in popularity.

In 2007, [[Ars Aevi]], a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.

===Music===
{{main article|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}
Typical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zonić]], [[Goran Bregović]], [[Davorin Popović]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Elvir Laković]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Hari Mata Hari]] and [[Dino Merlin]]. Other composers such as [[Đorđe Novković]], [[Al' Dino]], [[Haris Džinović]], [[Kornelije Kovač]], and many pop and [[Rock bands|rock band]]s, for example, [[Bijelo dugme|Bijelo Dugme]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Divlje Jagode]], [[Indexi]], [[Plavi orkestar|Plavi Orkestar]], [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Ambasadori]], [[Dubioza kolektiv]], who were among the leading ones in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia is home to the composer [[Dušan Šestić]], the creator of the current [[national anthem]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer [[Marija Šestić]], composer [[Saša Lošić]] and pianist [[Saša Toperić]]. In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient ''[[Gusle]]''. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.

Probably the most distinctive and identifiably &quot;Bosnian&quot; of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[saz (musical instrument)|saz]], a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.

===Cinema and theatre===
{{main article|List of Bosnia-Herzegovina films}}

Sarajevo is internationally renowned for its eclectic and diverse selection of festivals. The [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] was established in 1995, during the Bosnian War and has become the premier and largest film festival in the Balkans and South-East Europe.

Bosnia has a rich cinematic and film heritage, dating back to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]; many Bosnian filmmakers have achieved international prominence and some have won international awards ranging from the [[Academy Award]]s to multiple [[Palme d'Or]]s and [[Golden Bear]]s. Some notable Bosnian filmmakers, screenwriters and cinematographers are [[Danis Tanović]] (known for the Academy Award– and [[Golden Globe Award]]–winning 2001 film ''[[No Man's Land (2001 film)|No Man's Land]]'' and [[Jury Grand Prix|Silver Bear Grand Jury Prize]]–winning 2016 film ''[[Death in Sarajevo]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Home Festival Awards &amp; Juries: International Jury »Prizes Of The International Jury |website=www.berlinale.de/en |year=2016 |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dušan Vukotić]] (won an [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Oscar for best animated short]] film in 1961 for ''[[Ersatz (film)|Surogat]]'' (&quot;Ersatz&quot;), being the first foreigner to do so), [[Emir Kusturica]] (won two [[Palme d'Or]] at Cannes), [[Jasmila Žbanić]] (won Golden Bear), [[Ademir Kenović]]; [[Dino Mustafić]], [[Benjamin Filipović]], [[Jasmin Dizdar]], [[Pjer Žalica]], [[Srđan Vuletić]], [[Aida Begić]] etc.

===Cuisine===
{{main article|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}

[[File:Mostar - Bosnia and Herzegovina - Waitress.jpg|thumbnail|right|215px|A waitress in the Old City of [[Mostar]] wearing an old [[Bosniak]] dress]]
Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. Some local specialties are [[Ćevapčići|ćevapi]], [[burek]], [[dolma]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[pilav]], [[goulash]], [[ajvar]] and a whole range of Eastern sweets. Ćevapi is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of [[kebab]], popular in former Yugoslavia and considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|year=2009|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=27 July 2009|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/700826/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aoVUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=cevapcici|title=The new Encyclopaedia Britannica: A-ak&amp;nbsp;– Bayes, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pssZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=cevapcici|title=Countries and Their Cultures: Saint Kitts and Nevis to Zimbabwe|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=TravelSerbia.Info&amp;nbsp;– Your travel guide for Serbia|accessdate=9 August 2010|url=http://www.travelserbia.info/serbian-cuisine.php|title=Serbian cuisine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local wines come from [[Herzegovina]] where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Herzegovinian ''loza'' (similar to Italian [[Grappa]] but less sweet) is very popular. Plum (''rakija'') or apple (''jabukovača'') alcohol beverages are produced in the north. In the south, distilleries used to produce vast quantities of [[brandy]] and supply all of ex-Yugoslav alcohol factories (brandy is the base of most [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]]).
