Connecticut is also often grouped along with [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] as the [[Tri-State Area]]. It is bordered by [[Rhode Island]] to the east, [[Massachusetts]] to the north, [[New York (state)|New York]] to the west, and [[Long Island Sound]] to the south. Its capital city is [[Hartford]], and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]], a major U.S. river that approximately [[bisection|bisect]]s the state. The word &quot;Connecticut&quot; is derived from various [[anglicized]] spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for &quot;long tidal river&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood &amp; Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of southern and western Connecticut (along with the majority of the state's population) is part of the [[New York metropolitan area]]: three of Connecticut's eight counties are statistically included in the [[New York metropolitan area#Components of the metropolitan area|New York City combined statistical area]], which is widely referred to as the [[Tri-State area (NY-NJ-CT)|Tri-State area]].

Connecticut's first European settlers were [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]]. They established a small, short-lived settlement in present-day Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] rivers, called [[Fort Hoop|Huys de Goede Hoop]]. Initially, half of Connecticut was a part of the Dutch colony, [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] rivers. The first major settlements were established in the 1630s by England. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers overland from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded what would become the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven Colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in North America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a [[royal charter]], making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This colony was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against British rule in the [[American Revolution]].

The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports along the Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong [[wikt:Maritime|maritime]] tradition, which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the [[financial services]] industry, including [[insurance]] companies in Hartford and [[hedge fund]]s in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]]. As of the 2010 Census, Connecticut features the highest per-capita income, [[Human Development Index]] (0.962), and [[Household income in the United States|median household income in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 29, 2005 |title=Highest wages in East, lowest in South |work=[[USA Today]] |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2005-11-29-wage_x.htm |first=Stephen |last=Ohlemacher |accessdate=April 30, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkvtVNF?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fmoney%2Feconomy%2F2005-11-29-wage_x.htm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Median Household Income |date=2013 |website=American FactFinder |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmk |access-date=October 25, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6gpGlyhlr?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffactfinder.census.gov%2Ffaces%2Ftableservices%2Fjsf%2Fpages%2Fproductview.xhtml%3Fsrc%3Dbkmk |archivedate=April 17, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=July 17, 2008 |title=US slips down development index |work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7511426.stm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkxLjnC?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.bbc.co.uk%2F2%2Fhi%2Famericas%2F7511426.stm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;Connecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and third largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|275x275px|thumb|Map of Connecticut]]
The highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42° 3' N; 73° 29' W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet above sea level.

Connecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history—yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the &quot;race&quot; near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.

{{further information|List of Connecticut rivers}}

Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in the state), and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.

Connecticut consists of [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] of various [[Quercus|oaks]], [[beech]], [[Carya|hickories]], and [[Acer (genus)|maple]]. In the northwest part of the state, these give way to [[New England-Acadian forests]] of the [[Taconic Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olson |first1=David M. |last2=Dinerstein |first2=Eric |last3=Wikramanayake |first3=Eric D. |display-authors=etal |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=933–938 |url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/11/933 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5p1plFeFC?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.southwickma.org%2FPublic_Documents%2FF000102F9%2FS00476B50-00476B5B.0%2FThe%2520Southwick%2520Jog.pdf |archivedate=April 16, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKkzcI4A?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cslib.org%2Fjog.htm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's &quot;Panhandle&quot; |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uKl03gYx?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cslib.org%2Fpanhandle.htm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Connecticut has a [[humid continental climate]], with cold winters and warm humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a more mild humid [[temperate]] climate with seasonal extremes tempered by proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, warmer winters, and a longer frost-free season. Most of Connecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the USA average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archivedate=April 29, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early spring (April) can range from cool to warm, while mid and late spring (May/early June) is warm to hot. Summer is hot and often humid throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|87|F|C}} in Windsor Locks. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, summer thunderstorms often bring quick downpours with thunder and lightning. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the summer, occurring on average 30 times annually. These storms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;tornadoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif | title=Annual average number of tornadoes| publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center |format=[[GIF]] |accessdate=October 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; During hurricane season, tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region. Fall months are mild and bring colorful foliage across northern parts of the state (the southern and coastal areas have more oak and hickory trees and fewer maples) in October and November.

Winters are generally moderately cold from south to north in Connecticut, with average January temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|29|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|50–60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut. Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania–Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March, though snow has fallen from October to mid April in some years.

Connecticut's warmest temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the coldest temperature is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&amp;state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploration and early settlement===
The name Connecticut is derived from anglicized versions of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word that has been translated as &quot;long tidal river&quot; and &quot;upon the long river&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Project&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Federal Writers' Project |title=Connecticut: A Guide to Its Roads, Lore and People |url={{google books|CPYfSsQ-WE4C|page=3|plainurl=yes}} |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |publisher=US History Publishers |isbn=978-1-60354-007-0 |orig-year=1938 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Connecticut region was inhabited by multiple [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes before European settlement and colonization, including the [[Mohegan people|Mohegans]], the [[Pequot people|Pequots]], and the [[Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation|Paugusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cslib.org/tribes.htm Connecticut Native American Tribes]&quot;, Connecticut State Library.

The Connecticut Colony was originally a number of separate, smaller settlements at present-day Windsor, Wethersfield, Saybrook, Hartford, and New Haven. The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor, and then at Wethersfield the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/earlysettlers.htm |title=Early Settlers of Connecticut |publisher=Connecticut State Library |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420061052/http://www.cslib.org/earlysettlers.htm |archivedate=April 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Winthrop the Younger]] of Massachusetts received a commission to create a new colony at [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]] at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saybrookhistory.org/web_page.php?id=13 |title=Brief History of Old Saybrook |website=Old Saybrook Historical Society |access-date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. They were [[Puritan]]s from Massachusetts, led by [[Thomas Hooker]], who established the [[Connecticut Colony]] at Hartford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colonialwarsct.org/1636.htm |title=1636-Hartford |website=The Society of Colonial Wars in Connecticut |access-date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quinnipiack Colony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books|wmdJAAAAMAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=176}} |title=New Englander and Yale Review |volume=47 |pages=176–177 |editor-first1=Edward Royall |editor-last1=Tyler |editor-first2=William Lathrop |editor-last2=Kingsley |editor-first3=George Park |editor-last3=Fisher |editor-first4=Timothy |editor-last4=Dwight| display-editors = 3 |publisher=W.L. Kingsley |date=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established by [[John Davenport (clergyman)|John Davenport]], [[Theophilus Eaton]], and others at present-day New Haven in March 1638. The New Haven Colony had its own constitution, &quot;The Fundamental Agreement of the New Haven Colony&quot;, which was signed on June 4, 1639.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fundamental Agreement, or Original Constitution of the Colony of New Haven, June 4, 1639 |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/17th_century/ct01.asp |website=The Avalon Project: Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy |publisher=Yale Law School |accessdate=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlements were established without official sanction of the English Crown; each was an independent political entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1638_new_haven.htm |title=1638 - New Haven - The Independent Colony |website=The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut |access-date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They naturally were presumptively English but, in a legal sense, they were only secessionist outposts of Massachusetts Bay or expansions from Plymouth Colony. In 1662, Winthrop traveled to England and obtained a charter from [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] which united the settlements of Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=1662-Charter for Connecticut |website=The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut |url=http://colonialwarsct.org/1662.htm |access-date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically important colonial settlements included [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] (1633), [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] (1634), [[Deep River, Connecticut|Saybrook]] (1635), [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] (1636), [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] (1638), [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]] (1639), [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]] (1639), [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]] (1639), [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]] (1639), [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] (1640), [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] (1641), and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] (1646).

The Pequot War marked the first major clash between Colonial settlers and Indians in New England. The [[Pequot people|Pequots]] reacted with increasing aggression to Colonial settlements in their territory, while simultaneously taking lands from the [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] and [[Mohegan Indian Tribe|Mohegan]] tribes. Settlers responded to a murder in 1636 with a raid on a Pequot village on [[Block Island]]; the Pequots laid siege to Saybrook Colony's garrison that autumn, then raided Wethersfield in the spring of 1637. Colonists declared war on the Pequots, organized a band of militia and allies from the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes, and attacked a Pequot village on the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]], with death toll estimates ranging between 300 and 700 Pequots. After suffering another major loss at a battle in [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], the Pequots asked for a truce and peace terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{google books|YHVwmVKjhaoC|plainurl=yes|page=31}} |last=Williams |first=Tony |title=America's Beginnings: The Dramatic Events that Shaped a Nation's Character |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |date=2010 |pages=32–34 |isbn=978-1-4422-0487-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial Connecticut===
Yale College was established in 1701, providing Connecticut with an important institution to educate clergy and civil leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/about-yale/traditions-history |title=Traditions &amp; History |website=Yale University |access-date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congregational church dominated religious life in the colony and, by extension, town affairs in many parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=David M. |title=Connecticut: A History |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time. The [[Treaty of Hartford (1650)|Hartford Treaty]] with the Dutch was signed on September 19, 1650, but it was never ratified by the British. According to it, the western boundary of Connecticut ran north from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich Bay]] for a distance of {{convert|20|mile|km}},&lt;ref name=&quot;BOWEN&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowen |first=Clarence Winthrop |url={{google books|XJUNAAAAQAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=17}} |title=The Boundary Disputes of Connecticut |date=1882 | publisher=James R.

Conflict continued concerning colonial limits until the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] captured [[New Netherland]] in 1664.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOWEN&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FLICK&quot;/&gt;

On the other hand, Connecticut's original Charter in 1662 granted it all the land to the &quot;South Sea&quot;—that is, the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=A Chronology of US Historical Documents |url=http://www.law.ou.edu/ushistory/colony.shtml |title=Connecticut Colony Charter of 1662 |publisher=University of Oklahoma, College of Law |date=March 14, 2006 |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Colonial royal grants were for long east-west strips. Connecticut took its grant seriously and established a ninth county between the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and [[Delaware River]]s named [[Westmoreland County, Connecticut|Westmoreland County]]. This resulted in the brief [[Pennamite Wars]] with [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colonialwarsct.org/1769.htm |title=1769- The Pennamite Wars |website=The Society of Colonial Wars in the State of Connecticut |access-date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The American Revolution===

Connecticut designated four delegates to the [[Second Continental Congress]] who signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]: [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]], [[Roger Sherman]], [[William Williams (Continental Congress)|William Williams]], and [[Oliver Wolcott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_signers_gallery_facts.pdf |title=Signers of the Declaration of Independence |website=Charters of Freedom |publisher=National Archives |access-date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut's legislature authorized the outfitting of six new regiments in 1775, in the wake of the clashes between British regulars and Massachusetts militia at Lexington and Concord. There were some 1,200 Connecticut troops on hand at the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] in June 1775.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/military/hillprelim.html |title=Battle of Bunker's Hill Preliminary Study |website=Military Science, Cadet Resources |publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute |access-date=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British got word in 1777 of [[Continental Army]] supplies in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], and they landed an expeditionary force of some 2,000 troops in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]]. This force then marched to Danbury and destroyed homes and much of the depot. Continental Army troops and militia led by General [[David Wooster]] and General [[Benedict Arnold]] engaged them on their return march at [[Battle of Ridgefield|Ridgefield]] in 1777.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/accountoftryonsr00case#page/n3/mode/2up |last=Case |first=James R. |title=An Account of Tryon's Raid on Danbury in April, 1777 |location=Danbury, Connecticut |date=1927 |access-date=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the winter of 1778–79, General [[George Washington]] decided to split the Continental Army into three divisions encircling [[New York City]], where British General Sir [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]] had taken up winter quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poirier|first1=David A.|title=Camp Reading: Logistics of a Revolutionary War Winter Encampment|journal=Northeast Historical Archaeology|date=1976|volume=5|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.buffalostate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1326&amp;context=neha&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar%3Fq%3D%2522redding%252C%2Bconnecticut%2522%26btnG%3D%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D1%252C7%26as_vis%3D1#search=%22redding%2C%20connecticut%22|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major General [[Israel Putnam]] chose Redding as the winter encampment quarters for some 3,000 regulars and militia under his command. The Redding encampment allowed Putnam's soldiers to guard the replenished supply depot in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] and to support any operations along Long Island Sound and the [[Hudson River]] Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://putnampark.org/park-history/ |title=Park History |website=Putnam Memorial State Park |access-date=April 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the men were veterans of the winter encampment at [[Valley Forge]], [[Pennsylvania]] the previous winter. Soldiers at the Redding camp endured supply shortages, cold temperatures, and significant snow, with some historians dubbing the encampment &quot;Connecticut's Valley Forge&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=O'Keefe |first1=Thomas C. |editor1-last=Johnson |editor1-first=James M. |editor2-last=Pryslopski |editor2-first=Christopher |editor3-last=Villani |editor3-first=Andrew |title=Key to the Northern Country: The Hudson River Valley in the American Revolution |date=August 1, 2013 |publisher=[[SUNY Press]] |url={{google books|NfADAAAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes|page=241}} |accessdate=February 17, 2015 |chapter=George Washington and the Redding Encampments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state was also the launching site for a number of raids against Long Island orchestrated by [[Samuel Holden Parsons]] and [[Benjamin Tallmadge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall |first1=Charles Samuel |title=Life and Letters of Samuel Holden Parsons: Major-General in the Continental Army and Chief Judge of the Northwestern Territory, 1737-1789 |year=1905 |publisher=Otseningo Publishing |location=Binghamton, New York |page=110 |url={{google books|llssAAAAMAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=10}} |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided men and material for the war effort, especially to Washington's army outside New York City.

===Early National Period and Industrial Revolution===
Connecticut ratified the U.S. Constitution on January 9, 1788, becoming the fifth state.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; The state prospered during the era following the American Revolution, as mills and textile factories were built and seaports flourished from trade&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=La Bella |first1=Laura |title=Connecticut: Past and Present |date=August 15, 2010 |publisher=[[Rosen Publishing]] |location=New York |page=17 |url={{google books|ZYJtf6CoCs4C|plainurl=yes|page=17}} |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fisheries.

In 1786, Connecticut ceded territory to the U.S. government that became part of the [[Northwest Territory]]. The state retained land extending across the northern part of present-day Ohio called the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]].&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Summary 2010, page V-5&quot;&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=User Notes by Table: Table 12 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2010 |page=V-5 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio.

Connecticut made agreements with Pennsylvania and New York which extinguished her land claims within those states' boundaries and created the [[Connecticut Panhandle]]. The state then ceded the Western Reserve in 1800 to the federal government,&lt;ref name=&quot;United States Summary 2010, page V-5&quot;/&gt; which brought it to its present boundaries (other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts).

The British blockade during the [[War of 1812]] hurt exports and bolstered the influence of Federalists who opposed the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Boyland |first2=Glenn S. |last2=Gordinier |first3=Meredith |last3=Mason Brown |display-authors=etal |title=The Rockets' Red Glare: The War of 1812 and Connecticut |publisher=New London County Historical Society |date=2012 |isbn=978-0-9853-6240-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cessation of imports from Britain stimulated the construction of factories to manufacture textiles and machinery. Connecticut came to be recognized as a major center for manufacturing, due in part to the inventions of [[Eli Whitney]] and other early innovators of the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Charles R. |title=The Dawn of Innovation: The First American Industrial Revolution |date=2012 |publisher=[[PublicAffairs]] |page=136 |url={{google books|n97K02J6eQgC|plainurl=yes|page=136}} |isbn=978-1-6103-9049-1 |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state was known for its political conservatism, typified by its Federalist party and the Yale College of [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]]. The foremost intellectuals were Dwight and [[Noah Webster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=Emory |title=Revolutionary Writers: Literature and Authority in the New Republic, 1725-1810 |date=1986 |orig-year=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=14 |url={{google books|WmI6avgH0GoC|plainurl=yes|page=14}} |accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who compiled his great dictionary in New Haven. Religious tensions polarized the state, as the Congregational Church struggled to maintain traditional viewpoints, in alliance with the Federalists. The failure of the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814 hurt the Federalist cause, with the Republican Party gaining control in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/shortaccountofha00lyma#page/n1/mode/2up |last=Lyman |first=Theodore |title=A Short Account of the Hartford Convention |date=1823 |location=Boston |publisher=O.

Connecticut had been governed under the &quot;[[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]]&quot; since 1639, but the state adopted a new constitution in 1818.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/Content/constitutions/1818Constitution.htm |title=The Constitution of Connecticut (1818) |publisher=Connecticut General Assembly |access-date=May 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War era===

[[File:View of New London, Connecticut, from the Shore Road.jpg|thumb|View of New London in 1854]]
Connecticut manufacturers played a major role in supplying the Union forces with weapons and supplies during the [[Union (American Civil War)|Civil War]]. The state furnished 55,000 men, formed into thirty full regiments of infantry, including two in the [[U.S. Colored Troops]], with several Connecticut men becoming generals. The Navy attracted 250 officers and 2,100 men, and Glastonbury native [[Gideon Welles]] was Secretary of the Navy. [[James H. Ward]] of Hartford was the first U.S. Naval Officer killed in the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://norwich.typepad.com/museum/2012/08/james-h-ward-first-us-navy-officer-killed-in-the-civil-war.html| title=James H.

A surge of national unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, many Democrats (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a pro-slavery position and included many [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] willing to let the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won by the Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Joanna D. |last=Cowden |title=The Politics of Dissent: Civil War Democrats in Connecticut |journal=New England Quarterly |date=December 1983 |volume=56 |issue=4 |pp=538–554 |DOI=10.2307/365104 |jstor=365104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jarlath Robert |last=Lane |title=A Political History of Connecticut During the Civil War |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Industrial Revolution===
[[File:Connecticut1895.jpg|thumb|380px|1895 map from [[Rand McNally]]]]
Connecticut's extensive industry, dense population, flat terrain, and wealth encouraged the construction of railroads starting in 1839. By 1840, {{convert|102|mile|km}} of line were in operation, growing to {{convert|402|mile|km}} in 1850 and {{convert|601|mile|km}} in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Edward Chase |last=Kirkland |title=Men, Cities and Transportation, A Study of New England History 1820–1900 |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=1948 |volume=Vol 2 |pp=72–110, 288–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]], called the ''New Haven'' or &quot;The Consolidated&quot;, became the dominant Connecticut railroad company after 1872. [[J. P. Morgan]] began financing the major New England railroads in the 1890s, dividing territory so that they would not compete. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including steamship lines, and built a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over {{convert|2,000|mile|km}} of track with 120,000 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doddcenter.uconn.edu/asc/findaids/NHRR_Smallformat/MSS19910133.html |title=New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad Small Format Photograph and Postcard Collection |website=Archives &amp; Special Collections at the Thomas J.

In 1875, the first telephone exchange in the world was established in New Haven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/the-first-commercial-telephone-exchange-today-in-history/ |title=First Commercial Telephone Exchange |website=Connecticut History |access-date=May 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I===
When World War I broke out in 1914, Connecticut became a major supplier of weaponry to the U.S. military; by 1918, 80% of the state's industries were producing goods for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Industrial Northeast: Connecticut |chapter-url={{google books|EP7bDoZcGTIC|plainurl=yes|page=107}} |last=Breen |first=William J. |title=Labor Market Politics and the Great War: The Department of Labor, the States and the First U.S. Employment Service, 1907-1933 |location=Kent, Ohio |publisher=Kent State University Press |date=1997 |page=107 |ref=harv |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remington Arms]] in Bridgeport produced half the small-arms cartridges used by the U.S. Army,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/topics-page/world-war-i/ |title=World War I |website=Connecticut History |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other major suppliers including [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] in New Haven and [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]] in Hartford.{{sfn|Van Dusen|1961|pp=266-268}}

Connecticut was also an important U.S. Navy supplier, with [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Electric Boat]] receiving orders for 85 submarines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gdeb.com/about/history/ |title=EB History |publisher=General Dynamics Electric Boat |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Torpedo Boat]] building more than 20 subs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/2large/inactive/laketorpedo.htm |title=Lake Torpedo Boat Company, Bridgeport CT |website=Shipbuilding History |accessdate=May 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714141246/https://www.shipbuildinghistory.com/history/shipyards/2large/inactive/laketorpedo.htm |archivedate=July 14, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Groton Iron Works]] building freighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/freighter-worcester-launched-today-in-history/ |title=Freighter Worcester Launched |website=Connecticut History |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 21, 1916, the U.S. Navy made Groton the site for its East Coast submarine base and school.

The state enthusiastically supported the American war effort in 1917 and 1918, with large purchases of war bonds, a further expansion of industry, and an emphasis on increasing food production on the farms. Thousands of state, local, and volunteer groups mobilized for the war effort and were coordinated by the Connecticut State Council of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Breen |title=Mobilization and Cooperative Federalism: The Connecticut State Council of Defense, 1917‐1919 |work=Historian |date=1979 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pp=58–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers wrestled with manpower shortages; Waterbury's American Brass and Manufacturing Company was running at half capacity, so the federal government agreed to furlough soldiers to work there.{{sfn|Breen|1997|page=116}}

===Interwar period===
In 1919, J. Henry Roraback started the [[Northeast Utilities|Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Connecticut Light and Power Co.

In 1925, [[Frederick Rentschler]] spurred the creation of [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]] in Hartford to develop engines for aircraft; the company became an important military supplier in World War II and one of the three major manufacturers of jet engines in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalaviation.org/rentschler-frederick/ |title=Frederick Rentschler |website=The National Aviation Hall of Fame |access-date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1938, the most destructive storm in New England history struck eastern Connecticut, killing hundreds of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.gov/okx/1938HurricaneHome |title=The Great New England Hurricane of 1938 |website=National Weather Service |access-date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eye of the [[1938 New England hurricane|&quot;Long Island Express&quot;]] passed just west of New Haven and devastated the Connecticut shoreline between Old Saybrook and Stonington from the full force of wind and waves, as they the partial protection provided by Long Island. The hurricane caused extensive damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses. In New London, a 500-foot sailing ship was driven into a warehouse complex, causing a major fire. Heavy rainfall caused the Connecticut River to flood downtown Hartford and East Hartford. An estimated 50,000 trees fell onto roadways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/21/nyregion/remembering-the-great-hurricane-of-38.html |title=Remembering the Great Hurricane of '38 |publisher=New York Times |date=September 21, 2003 |accessdate=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
The advent of [[Lend-Lease]] in support of Britain helped lift Connecticut from the Great Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=http://content.library.ccsu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/ccsutheses/id/1014 |last=Brandi |first=Anthony P. |type=Masters of Arts |title=Lend-lease: FDR's Most Unheralded Achievement and Connecticut's Unprecedented Response to it |publisher=Central Connecticut State University |date=May 2007 |access-date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the state a major production center for weaponry and supplies used in [[World War II]].

===Post-World War II economic expansion===
Connecticut lost some wartime factories following the end of hostilities, but the state shared in a general post-war expansion that included the construction of highways&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ct.gov/dot/cwp/view.asp?A=1380&amp;Q=259704 |title=Interstate Highways Given New Life by Federal Aid Highway Acts |website=Department of Transportation |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=September 9, 2003 |access-date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and resulting in middle-class growth in suburban areas.

===Late 20th century===
Connecticut's dependence on the defense industry posed an economic challenge at the end of the [[Cold War]]. The resulting budget crisis helped elect [[Lowell Weicker]] as governor on a third-party ticket in 1990.

He did not run for a second term, in part because of this politically unpopular move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/gov/weickerl.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324093619/http://www.cslib.org/gov/weickerl.htm |archivedate=March 24, 2014 |df=mdy }} &quot;Lowell Weicker Governor of Connecticut, 1991–1995&quot;, Connecticut State Library, 2008.

The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Connecticut was 3,590,886 on July 1, 2015, a 0.47% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PopEstUS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF |title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015 |website=American FactFinder |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=December 26, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129082905/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF |archivedate=November 29, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, Connecticut had an estimated population of 3,590,886,&lt;ref name=&quot;PopEstUS&quot;/&gt; which is an decrease of 5,791, or -0.16%, from the prior year and an increase of 16,789, or 0.47%, since the year 2010. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 67,427 people (that is 222,222 births minus 154,795 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 41,718 people into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 75,991 people, and [[Human migration|migration]] within the country produced a net loss of 34,273 people. Based on the 2005 estimates, Connecticut moves from the 29th most populous state to 30th.

6.6% of its population was reported as being under 5 years old, 24.7% under 18 years old, and 13.8% were 65 years of age or older. Females made up approximately 51.6% of the population, with 48.4% male.

In 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as &quot;rural&quot;. The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, only 12.3% was considered rural. Most of western and southern Connecticut (particularly the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]]) is strongly associated with New York City; this area is the most affluent and populous region of the state and has high property costs and high incomes. The [[center of population]] of Connecticut is located in the town of [[Cheshire, Connecticut|Cheshire]].&lt;ref name=NGS/&gt;

===Taxation===
Before 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only [[income tax]] system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing.

In 1991, under Governor [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], an Independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. The new tax policy drew investment firms to Connecticut; as of 2014, [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] was home to the headquarters for 14 of the 200 largest [[hedge fund]]s in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=file:///Users/casoule/Downloads/FILE_aec2f15d619800a8503f9902c0b81750Top200Managers.pdf |title=Top 200 Hedge Fund Managers |website=Hedge Fund Alert |subscription=yes}}{{dead link|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals are divided into six tax brackets of 3% (on income up to $10,000); 5% ($10,000-$50,000); 5.5% ($50,000-$100,000); 6% ($100,000-$200,000); 6.5% ($200,000-$250,000); and 6.7% (more than $250,000), with additional amounts owed depending on the bracket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tax-brackets.org/connecticuttaxtable |title=Connecticut Income Tax Brackets |website=Tax-Brackets.org |date=2015 |access-date=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All wages of Connecticut residents are subject to the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have higher tax rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.

Connecticut levies a 6.35% state [[sales tax]] on the retail sale, lease, or rental of most goods.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011Sect6Summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Summary of Tax Provisions Contained in 2011 Conn.

[[Oyster]] harvesting was historically an important source of income to towns along the Connecticut coastline. In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns. In 1911, Connecticut's oyster production reached its peak at nearly 25 million pounds of oyster meats. This was, at the time, higher than production in New York, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://connecticuthistory.org/oystering-in-connecticut-from-colonial-times-to-today/ |website=Connecticut History |title=Oystering in Connecticut, from Colonial Times to the 21st Century |access-date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, the Connecticut coast was known in the shellfishing industry as the oyster capital of the world.  From before World War 1 until 1969, Connecticut laws restricted the right to harvest oysters in state-owned beds to sailing vessels. These laws prompted the construction of the oyster sloop style vessel that lasted well into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=This Fine Piece of Water: An Environmental History of Long Island Sound |first=Tom |last=Andersen |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2004 |orig-year=2002 |edition=revised |p=90 |url={{google books|WsvwJKNIewsC|plainurl=yes|page=90}} |isbn=978-0-3001-0287-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sloop {{ship||Hope|sloop|2}} is believed to be the last oyster sloop built in Connecticut, completed in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] in 1948.

===Roads===
{{main article |List of State Routes in Connecticut}}
The [[Interstate highway]]s in the state are [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate&amp;nbsp;95]] (I-95; the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] traveling southwest to northeast in the center of the state, [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] traveling north to south in the center of the state, and [[Interstate 395 in Connecticut|I-395]] traveling north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Connecticut Route 15]] (Route&amp;nbsp;15), traveling from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York City|New York]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven]] and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]]. I-95 and Route&amp;nbsp;15 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ |title=Connecticut Turnpike (I-95) |website=NYC Roads |access-date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route&amp;nbsp;7]] (US&amp;nbsp;7) in the west traveling parallel to the New York state line, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route&amp;nbsp;8]] farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and traveling north–south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with US&amp;nbsp;7, and [[Connecticut Route 9]] in the east.

Between New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area. This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity, resulting in lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[carpool|ride-sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://ctrides.com/ways-to-commute/carpool | title=Ways to Commute |website= CT rides |publisher=State of Connecticut |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycle ownership and use in the United States. New Haven's cycling community, organized in a local advocacy group called [[ElmCityCycling]], is particularly active. According to the US Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Constitutional history===
{{Main article|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}
Connecticut is known as the &quot;Constitution State&quot;. The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.

The nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638–39. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.

Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.

===Executive===
The governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2011}}, [[Dannel Malloy]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | work=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nancy Wyman]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

Malloy, the former mayor of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], won the [[Connecticut gubernatorial election, 2010|2010 general election]] for Governor, and was sworn in on January 5, 2011. From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.&lt;ref name=Pumont/&gt;

There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy &amp; Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Department-and-Agencies/ |title=Departments and Agencies |website=Portal.CT.gov |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: Secretary of the State, Treasurer, Comptroller, and Attorney General. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt;

===Legislative===
The legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[President pro tempore]] presides.

===Judicial===
The highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of the law or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court, with no testimony given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. {{As of|2015|}} the [[Chief Justice]] is [[Chase T. Rogers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jud.state.ct.us/external/supapp/justiceRogers.html | title=Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers | publisher=State of Connecticut | work=Biographies of Supreme Court Justices, Judicial Branch | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.state.ct.us/ystday/history.html |title=About Connecticut Courts: History of the  Courts |website=Judicial Branch |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Appellate Court is a lesser statewide court and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states.

The State of Connecticut also offers access to [[Arrest warrant]] enforcement statistics through the Office of Policy and Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2969&amp;Q=383588&amp;opm_Nav_GID=1797 |title=Monthly Arrest Warrant Report |website=Office of Policy and Management |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=October 1, 2015 |accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local government===
{{See also|Administrative divisions of Connecticut}}
::''and several lists:'' [[List of municipalities of Connecticut by population]], [[List of towns in Connecticut]], [[List of cities in Connecticut]], [[Borough (Connecticut)]], [[List of counties in Connecticut]]
Connecticut does not have [[County (United States)|county]] government, unlike all other states except Rhode Island. Connecticut county governments were mostly eliminated in 1960, with the exception of [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]] elected in each county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&amp;q=392376 |website=State Register and Manual |publisher=State of Connecticut |title=Section VI: Counties |accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the county sheriff was abolished and replaced with the [[Connecticut State Marshal|state marshal]] system, which has districts that follow the old county territories. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/directory/directory/location/Default.htm |title=Judicial District Courts Staff Directory |website=State of Connecticut Judicial Branch |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[list of Connecticut counties|eight counties]] are still widely used for purely geographical and statistical purposes, such as [[Weather forecasting|weather reports]] and census reporting.

Connecticut shares with the rest of [[New England]] a governmental institution called the [[New England town]]. The state is divided into 169 towns which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; There are also 21 cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt; most of which simply follow the boundaries of their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: the [[Groton (city), Connecticut|City of Groton]], which is a subsection of the [[Groton (town), Connecticut|Town of Groton]], and the City of [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]] in the Town of [[Winchester, Connecticut|Winchester]]. There are also nine incorporated [[Borough (Connecticut)|boroughs]] which may provide additional services to a section of town.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Town Elections, Boroughs in Connecticut with Date of Incorporation |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=June 19, 2013 |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&amp;q=392430#CITIES_IN_CONNECTICUT_WITH_DATE_OF_INCORPORATION |access-date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naugatuck]] is a consolidated town and borough.

The state is also divided into 15 [[Administrative divisions of Connecticut#Regions|planning regions]] defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, with the exception of the Town of Stafford in Tolland County.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPM&quot;&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2985&amp;q=383124 |title=Regional Planning Coordination |website=Office of Policy and Management |publisher=State of Connecticut |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions. Each region has an administrative body known as a regional council of governments, a regional council of elected officials, or a regional planning agency. The regions are established for the purpose of planning &quot;coordination of regional and state planning activities; redesignation of logical planning regions and promotion of the continuation of regional planning organizations within the state; and provision for technical aid and the administration of financial assistance to regional planning organizations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;OPM&quot;/&gt;

===Registered voters===
Connecticut residents who register to vote have the option of declaring an affiliation to a political party, may become unaffiliated at will, and may change affiliations subject to certain waiting periods. {{as of|2016}} about 60% of registered voters are enrolled (just over 1% total in 28 [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] minor parties), and ratios among unaffiliated voters and the two major parties are about 8 unaffiliated for every 7 in the [[Democratic Party of Connecticut]] and for every 4 in the [[Connecticut Republican Party]].

(Among the minor parties, the [[Libertarian Party of Connecticut|Libertarian Party]] and [[Connecticut Green Party|Green Party]] appeared in the Presidential-electors column in 2016, and drew, respectively, 2.96% and 1.39% of the vote.)

Many Connecticut towns show a marked preference for moderate candidates of either party.{{Ref}}

===Political office===
Elections in Connecticut take place mostly at the levels of town and/or city, state legislative districts for both houses, Congressional districts, and statewide. In almost all races, the two major parties have some practical advantages granted on the basis of their respective performances in the most recent election covering the same constituency. Several processes, to varying degrees internal to either a major or minor party, are in practice nearly prerequisites to being permitted mention on the provided ballots, and even more so to winning office.

More specifically, the status of &quot;major party&quot; is usually reconfirmed every four years, as belonging to the two parties that polled best, statewide, in the gubernatorial column; this status includes the benefit of appearing in one of the top two rows on the ballot provided the party has at least one candidate on the ballot. Minor parties appear below major parties, and their performance in recent elections determines whether a candidates who wins in their nomination process must also meet a petitioning threshold in order to appear.

In a major party, a party convention for the office's constituency must be held; in practice, at the town level, a major party convention of voters of the town who are enrolled in the party usually is attended almost exclusively by members of the town party committee. The convention may choose to endorse a candidate, who will appear on the ballot unless additional candidates meet a petition threshold for a primary election; if at least one candidate meets the petition threshold, the endorsed candidate and all who meet the threshold appear on the primary ballot, and the winner of the primary election appears on the party line for that office.

A candidate wishing to run on the ballot line of a minor-party which has recently enough met a general-election vote threshold follows similar steps; candidates of other minor parties must meet petition thresholds, and if other candidates of the same party, for the same office, do so as well, only the winner of a resulting primary will appear on the ballot.

Campaigns by candidates not on the ballot generally are entirely symbolic, and while any voter can cast a write-in ballot, write-in ballots are not even tallied by election officials, except for candidates who have submitted a formal request that the tally be made.

In short, most winning candidates have won the endorsement of the applicable &quot;major&quot;-party convention; nearly all of the rest have won with a &quot;professionally managed&quot; primary-election campaign; and successful minor-party candidates are almost without exception major-party figures like [[Lowell Weicker]] whose minor parties disappear after that success. [[A Connecticut Party]], which Weicker founded, became nominally the leading major party, and state law was changed during his administration to provide that in a situation such as his win, the top &quot;three&quot; parties in the governor's race all became major parties.

[[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]] and [[Richard Blumenthal]] are Connecticut's [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]]; both are Democrats.

The suburban towns of [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] and [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in Fairfield County are considered the most Republican areas in the state. [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], a wealthy town a few miles to the east, is often considered one of the most loyally Democratic, liberal towns in Fairfield County. The historically Republican-leaning wealthy town of [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]] voted in the majority for [[Barack Obama]] in the 2008 Presidential Election. [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]], the namesake of the [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|county]], has historically favored moderate Republicans in municipal, congressional, senatorial, and gubernatorial campaigns, but in recent years has supported Democratic Presidential nominees. [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], two larger, mixed-income communities in Fairfield County, have in many elections favored moderate Republicans including former Governor [[John G. Rowland]] and former Congressman [[Chris Shays]], however they have favored Democrats in recent US presidential election years, with Shays being defeated by Democrat [[Jim Himes]] in the 2008 election.

The state's Republican-leaning areas are the rural [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]] and adjoining towns in the west of [[Hartford County, Connecticut|Hartford County]], the industrial towns of the [[Naugatuck River Valley]], and some of the affluent [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] towns near the New York border.

Joe Lieberman's predecessor, [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]], was the last Connecticut Republican to serve as Senator. Weicker was known as a liberal Republican. He broke with President [[Richard Nixon]] during [[Watergate Scandal|Watergate]] and successfully ran for governor in 1990 as an independent, creating [[A Connecticut Party]] as his election vehicle. Before Weicker, the last [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to represent Connecticut in the Senate was [[Prescott Bush]], the father of former President [[George H.W. Bush]] and the grandfather of former President [[George W. Bush]]. He served 1953–63.

===Democratic areas===
[[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] has a Democratic registration edge, but usually favors conservative candidates of both traditional parties. In [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] unaffiliated voters outnumber voters registered with either major party. Other smaller cities including [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]] favor Democratic candidates. The state's major cities—[[Hartford]], [[New Haven]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]—are all strongly Democratic.

{{As of|2011}}, Democrats controlled all five federal congressional seats. The last Republican to be elected, [[Chris Shays]], lost his seat to Democrat Jim Himes in 2008.

===Voting===
In April 2012 both houses of the Connecticut state legislature passed a bill (20&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;16 and 86&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;62) that abolished the [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]] for all future crimes, while 11 inmates who were waiting on the [[death row]] at the time could still be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/04/25/connecticut-governor-signs-bill-to-repeal-death-penalty/ |title = Connecticut governor signs bill to repeal death penalty |date=April 25, 2012 |work=FOX News |accessdate = April 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 the Connecticut legislature overrode a veto by Governor [[M. Jodi Rell]] to pass [[SustiNet]], the first significant public-option health care reform legislation in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health Reform Alive: Legislature Overrides Rell Veto Of Sustinet Care Plan, Six Other Bills |work=Hartford Courant |date=July 21, 2009 |first=Christopher |last=Keating |url=http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name &quot;Connecticut&quot; originated with the [[Mohegan]] word ''quonehtacut'', meaning &quot;place of long tidal river&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutCT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/about/ |title=General Description &amp; Facts |website=Portal.CT.gov |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut's official nickname is &quot;The Constitution State&quot;, adopted in 1959 and based on its colonial constitution of 1638–39 which was the first in America and, arguably, the world.&lt;ref name=SOTS&gt;{{cite web |title=Sites, Seals &amp; Symbols |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?A=3188&amp;QUESTION_ID=392608 |date=August 28, 2015 |ref=SOTS |accessdate=October 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connecticut is also unofficially known as &quot;The [[Nutmeg]] State,&quot;&lt;ref name = SOTS/&gt; whose origins are unknown. It may have come from its sailors returning from voyages with nutmeg, which was a very valuable spice in the 18th and 19th centuries. It may have originated in the early machined sheet tin nutmeg grinders sold by early Connecticut peddlers. It is also facetiously said to come from [[Yankee]] peddlers from Connecticut who would sell small carved nobs of wood shaped to look like nutmeg to unsuspecting customers.&lt;ref name = &quot;cslib&quot; /&gt; [[George Washington]] gave Connecticut the title of &quot;The Provisions State&quot;&lt;ref name=SOTS/&gt; because of the material aid that the state rendered to the [[American Revolutionary War]] effort. Connecticut is also known as &quot;The Land of Steady Habits&quot;.&lt;ref name=SOTS /&gt;

According to Webster's New International Dictionary (1993), a person who is a native or resident of Connecticut is a &quot;Connecticuter&quot;. There are numerous other terms coined in print but not in use, such as &quot;Connecticotian&quot; ([[Cotton Mather]] in 1702) and &quot;Connecticutensian&quot; ([[Samuel Peters]] in 1781). Linguist Allen Walker Read suggests the more playful term &quot;connecticutie.&quot; &quot;[[Nutmegger]]&quot; is sometimes used,&lt;ref name=&quot;cslib&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cslib.org/nicknamesCT.htm |title=Connecticut's Nicknames |website=Connecticut State Library |accessdate=September 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905051813/http://www.cslib.org/nicknamesCT.htm |archivedate=September 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as is &quot;[[Yankee]].&quot; The official state song is &quot;[[Yankee Doodle]]&quot;), though this usually refers to someone from the wider [[New England]] region. (In the Southern United States, the term &quot;Yankee&quot; refers to anyone who lives north of the [[Mason–Dixon line]].) The traditional abbreviation of the state's name is &quot;Conn.;&quot; the official [[United States postal abbreviations|postal abbreviation]] is CT.

[[Commemorative stamp]]s issued by the [[United States Postal Service]] with Connecticut themes include [[Nathan Hale]], [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], [[Noah Webster]], [[Eli Whitney]], the [[whaling]] ship the [[Charles W.
