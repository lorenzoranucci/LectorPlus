'''Blind Willie McTell''' (born '''William Samuel McTier'''; May 5, 1898 – August 19, 1959) was a [[Piedmont blues]] and [[ragtime]] singer and guitarist. He played with a fluid, syncopated [[fingerstyle guitar]] technique, common among many exponents of Piedmont blues. Unlike his contemporaries, he came to use [[twelve-string guitar]]s exclusively. McTell was also an adept [[Slide (guitar)|slide guitarist]], unusual among ragtime bluesmen. His vocal style, a smooth and often laid-back [[tenor]], differed greatly from many of the harsher voices of [[Delta blues|Delta]] bluesmen such as [[Charley Patton]]. McTell performed in various musical styles, including [[blues]], [[ragtime]], [[Gospel music|religious music]] and [[hokum]].

McTell was born in [[Thomson, Georgia]]. He learned to play the guitar in his early teens. He soon became a street performer in several Georgia cities, including [[Atlanta]] and [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], and first recorded in 1927 for [[Victor Records]]. He never produced a major [[hit record]], but he had a prolific recording career with different labels and under different names in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1940, he was recorded by the folklorist [[John A. Lomax]] and [[Ruby Terrill Lomax]] for the folk song archive of the [[Library of Congress]]. He was active in the 1940s and 1950s, playing on the streets of Atlanta, often with his longtime associate [[Curley Weaver]]. Twice more he recorded professionally. His last recordings originated during an impromptu session recorded by an Atlanta record store owner in 1956. McTell died three years later, having suffered for years from diabetes and alcoholism. Despite his lack of commercial success, he was one of the few blues musicians of his generation who continued to actively play and record during the 1940s and 1950s. He did not live to see the [[American folk music revival]], in which many other bluesmen were &quot;rediscovered.&quot;&lt;ref name=NGE/&gt;

McTell's influence extended over a wide variety of artists, including the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]], who covered his &quot;[[Statesboro Blues]],&quot; and [[Bob Dylan]], who paid tribute to him in his 1983 song &quot;[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]],&quot; the refrain of which is &quot;And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.&quot; Other artists influenced by McTell include [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Alvin Youngblood Hart]], [[Ralph McTell]], [[Chris Smither]] and the [[The White Stripes|White Stripes]].

==Biography==
He was born William Samuel McTier&lt;ref name=UNC&gt;Conner, Patrick. &quot;[http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/piedmontblues/mctell.html Blind Willie McTell]&quot;. ''East Coast Piedmont Blues''. University of North Carolina. Retrieved 2011-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Thomson, Georgia]], [[Blindness|blind]] in one eye.  Although most sources date his birth to 1898, researchers Bob Eagle and Eric LeBlanc suggest 1903, based on his entry in the [[1910 census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bare&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues - A Regional Experience| publisher= Praeger Publishers| location= Santa Barbara| pages=270 | isbn= 978-0313344237}}&lt;/ref&gt;   McTell lost his remaining vision by late childhood. He attended schools for the blind in Georgia, New York and Michigan and showed proficiency in music from an early age, first playing the harmonica and accordion, learning to read and write music in [[Braille]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NGE&quot;/&gt; and turning to the six-string guitar in his early teens.&lt;ref name=NGE&gt;Jacobs, Hal. &quot;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-875 Blind Willie McTell]&quot;. ''The New Georgia Encyclopedia''. 2009-11-03. Retrieved 2011-06-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UNC /&gt; His family background was rich in music; both of his parents and an uncle played the guitar. He was related to the bluesman and gospel pioneer [[Thomas A. Dorsey]].&lt;ref name=UNC /&gt; McTell's father left the family when Willie was young. After his mother died, in the 1920s, he left his hometown and became an itinerant musician, or &quot;[[songster]].&quot; He began his recording career in 1927 for [[Victor Records]] in [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref name=green&gt;Green, Justin. ''Musical Legends''. ISBN 0-86719-587-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

McTell married Ruth Kate Williams,&lt;ref name=&quot;NGE&quot;/&gt; now better known as [[Kate McTell]], in 1934. She accompanied him on stage and on several recordings before becoming a nurse in 1939. For most of their marriage, from 1942 until his death, they lived apart, she in [[Fort Gordon]], near Augusta, and he working around Atlanta.

In the years before [[World War II]], McTell traveled and performed widely, recording for several labels under different names: Blind Willie McTell (for Victor and Decca), Blind Sammie (for Columbia), Georgia Bill (for Okeh), Hot Shot Willie (for Victor), Blind Willie (for Vocalion and Bluebird), Barrelhouse Sammie (for Atlantic), and Pig &amp; Whistle Red (for Regal). The appellation &quot;Pig &amp; Whistle&quot; was a reference to a chain of barbecue restaurants in Atlanta;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} McTell often played for tips in the parking lot of a Pig 'n Whistle restaurant. He also played behind a nearby building that later became Ray Lee's Blue Lantern Lounge. Like his fellow [[songster]] Lead Belly, who also began his career as a street artist, McTell favored the somewhat unwieldy and unusual [[twelve-string guitar]], whose greater volume made it suitable for outdoor playing.

In 1940 John A. Lomax and his wife, [[Ruby Terrill Lomax]], a professor of [[classics]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], interviewed and recorded McTell for the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress in a two-hour session held in their hotel room in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell 3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books|location=Dubai|page=13|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recordings document McTell's distinctive musical style, which bridges the gap between the raw country blues of the early part of the 20th century and the more conventionally melodious, [[ragtime]]-influenced East Coast Piedmont blues sound. The Lomaxes also elicited from the singer traditional songs (such as [[Boll Weevil (song)|&quot;The Boll Weevil&quot;]] and [[John Henry (folklore)#Music|&quot;John Henry&quot;]]) and spirituals (such as &quot;[[Amazing Grace]]&quot;), which were not part of his usual commercial repertoire. In the interview, John A. Lomax is heard asking if McTell knows any &quot;complaining&quot; songs (an earlier term for [[protest song]]s), to which the singer replies somewhat uncomfortably and evasively that he does not. The Library of Congress paid McTell $10, the equivalent of $154.56 in 2011, for this two-hour session.&lt;ref name=green /&gt; The material from this 1940 session was issued in 1960 as an LP and later as a CD, under the somewhat misleading title ''The Complete Library of Congress Recordings'', notwithstanding the fact that it was truncated, in that it omitted some of John A. Lomax's interactions with the singer and entirely omitted the contributions of Ruby Terrill Lomax.&lt;ref&gt;McTell's biographer [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] attributes these omissions to the folklore archivist Rae Korson, who was evidently hostile to his New Deal folklore predecessors at the library: &quot;The widely sold version of the McTell-Lomax sessions deletes conversations and information, removes Ruby Lomax from the room almost entirely—making John Lomax seem to monopolize things and keep her silent, which he doesn’t at all—and robs Lomax of several touches of warmth and humanity, including questions asked by Ruby Terrill and John Lomax.&quot; Gray, Michael (2009). ''Hand Me My Travelin’ Shoes: In Search of Blind Willie McTell''. Chicago Review Press. p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;

McTell recorded for [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Regal Records (1949)|Regal Records]] in 1949, but these recordings met with less commercial success than his previous works. He continued to perform around Atlanta, but his career was cut short by ill health, mostly due to [[diabetes]] and alcoholism. In 1956, an Atlanta record store manager, Edward Rhodes, discovered McTell playing in the street for quarters and enticed him with a bottle of corn liquor into his store, where he captured a few final performances on a tape recorder. These recordings were released posthumously by Prestige/[[Bluesville Records]] as ''Last Session''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluesnet.hub.org/readings/mctell.html|title=Blind Willie McTell|publisher=bluesnet|accessdate=November 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1957, McTell was a preacher at Atlanta's Mt. Zion Baptist Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGE&quot;/&gt;

McTell died of a stroke in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], in 1959. He was buried at Jones Grove Church, near Thomson, Georgia, his birthplace. A fan paid to have a gravestone erected on his resting place. The name given on his gravestone is Willie Samuel McTier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=6700344|title=Willie &quot;Blind Willie&quot; McTell (1901–1959) – Find a Grave Memorial|publisher=|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[Blues Foundation]]'s [[Blues Hall of Fame]] in 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?YearId=24 |title=1981 Hall of Fame Inductees|accessdate=February 5, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210120359/http://blues.org/halloffame/inductees.php4?YearId=24 |archivedate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Georgia Music Hall of Fame]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;NGE&quot;/&gt;

In his recording of &quot;Statesboro Blues,&quot; he pronounces his surname &quot;MacTell,&quot; with the stress on the first syllable.

==Influence==
[[File:StatesboroBlues.jpg|thumb|right|Label of one of McTell's most notable works, &quot;Statesboro Blues&quot;]]
One of McTell's most famous songs, &quot;[[Statesboro Blues]],&quot; was frequently covered by the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]] and was one of their earliest signature songs{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. A short list of some of the artists who have performed the song includes [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[David Bromberg]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[The Devil Makes Three (band)|The Devil Makes Three]] and [[Ralph McTell]], who changed his name on account of liking the song.&lt;ref&gt;Hockenhull, Chris (1997). ''Streets of London: The Official Biography of Ralph McTell''. Northdown. p. 40. ISBN 1-900711-02-8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ry Cooder]] covered McTell's &quot;Married Man's a Fool&quot; on his 1973 album, ''[[Paradise and Lunch]]''. [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], of the [[The White Stripes]] considers McTell an influence; the White Stripes album ''[[De Stijl (album)|De Stijl]]'' (2000) is dedicated to him and features a cover of his song &quot;Southern Can Is Mine.&quot; The White Stripes also covered McTell's &quot;[[Lord, Send Me an Angel]]&quot;, releasing it as a single in 2000. In 2013 Jack White's Third Man Records teamed up with Document Records to issue ''The Complete Recorded Works in Chronological Order of Charley Patton, Blind Willie McTell and the Mississippi Sheiks''.

[[Bob Dylan]] paid tribute to McTell on at least four occasions. In his 1965 song &quot;[[Highway 61 Revisited]],&quot; the second verse begins, &quot;Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose,&quot; a reference to one of McTell's many recording names. Dylan's song &quot;[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]]&quot; was recorded in 1983 and released in 1991 on ''[[The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3]]''. Dylan also recorded covers of McTell's &quot;Broke Down Engine&quot; and &quot;Delia&quot; on his 1993 album, ''[[World Gone Wrong]]'';&lt;ref&gt;In the liner notes for that album, Dylan wrote, &quot;'Broke Down Engine' is a Blind Willie McTell masterpiece ... it's about Ambiguity, the fortunes of the privileged elite, flood control—watching the red dawn not bothering to dress [sic].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Dylan's song &quot;Po' Boy&quot;, on the album ''[[Love and Theft (Bob Dylan album)|Love and Theft]]'' (2001), contains the lyric &quot;had to go to Florida dodging them Georgia laws,&quot; which comes from McTell's &quot;Kill It Kid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Kill it Kid&quot;, ''Last Session'', Bluesville BV 1040, released 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bath-based band [[Kill It Kid]] is named after the song of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/03/12/kill-it-kid-interview-sxsw-2010/ |title=kill it kid interview sxsw 2010 |publisher=Spinner.com |date=12 March 2010 |accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A blues bar in Atlanta is named after McTell and regularly features blues musicians and bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;blindwilliesblues.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blindwilliesblues.com/|title=Blind Willie's – Atlanta's Finest Blues Bar|website=Blindwillieblues.com|accessdate=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blind Willie McTell Blues Festival is held annually in Thomson, Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;blindwilliesblues.com&quot;/&gt;
