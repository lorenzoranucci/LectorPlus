'''BT Group plc''' ([[doing business as|trading as]] '''BT''') is a [[holding company]] which owns '''British Telecommunications plc''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Group businesses|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|publisher=BT Group plc|accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a British [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] telecommunications services company with head offices in London, [[United Kingdom]]. It has operations in around 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our company|url=http://btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|website=BT Group plc|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BT's origins date back to the founding of the [[Electric Telegraph Company]] in 1846 which developed a nationwide communications network. In 1912, the [[General Post Office]], a government department, became the monopoly telecoms supplier in the United Kingdom. The Post Office Act of 1969 led to the GPO becoming a public corporation. British Telecommunications, trading as ''British Telecom'', was formed in 1980, and became independent of the Post Office in 1981. British Telecommunications was privatised in 1984, becoming ''British Telecommunications plc'', with some 50 percent of its shares sold to investors. The Government sold its remaining stake in further share sales in 1991 and 1993. BT has a primary listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]], a secondary listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]].

BT controls a number of large subsidiaries. [[BT Global Services]] division supplies telecoms services to corporate and government customers worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Companyprofile/Groupbusinesses/BTGlobalServices/index.htm|title=BT Global Services|accessdate=24 August 2010|publisher=BT Group plc| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100810172518/http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Companyprofile/Groupbusinesses/BTGlobalServices/index.htm| archivedate= 10 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[BT Consumer]] division supplies [[telephony]], [[internet access|broadband]], and [[pay television|subscription television]] services in Great Britain to around 18&amp;nbsp;million customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/btconsumer/index.htm|title=BT Consumer|accessdate=20 December 2014|publisher=BT Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT announced in February 2015 that it had agreed to acquire EE for £12.5 billion,&lt;ref name=&quot;BT acquisition&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=BT to buy mobile firm EE for £12.5bn|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-31144009|website=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 February 2015|date=5 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received final regulatory approval from the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] on 15 January 2016.&lt;ref name=CMA&gt;{{Cite web|title = BT takeover of EE gets final Competition and Markets Authority clearance|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35320831|website = BBC News|accessdate = 15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transaction was completed on 29 January 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;BTEE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4-traders.com/BT-GROUP-PLC-4003616/news/BT-Group-PLC-Completion-of-the-acquisition-of-EE-Limited-21767295/ |title=BT Group PLC Completion of the acquisition of EE Limited |publisher=4-traders |date=29 January 2016 |accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Christopher|title=EE chief Olaf Swantee exits as BT takeover approaches|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/telecoms/12079963/EE-chief-Olaf-Swantee-exits-as-BT-takeover-approaches.html|accessdate=11 January 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
BT's origins date back to the establishment of the first telecommunications companies in Britain.  Among them was the first commercial [[Telegraphy|telegraph service]], the [[Electric Telegraph Company]], established in 1846. As these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed, the remaining companies were transferred to [[Government-owned corporation|state control]] under the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] in 1912. These companies were merged and [[Rebranding|rebranded]] as British Telecom.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/ | title = The historical development of BT | year = 2010 | accessdate =12 June 2010 | publisher=BT Group| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527143141/http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/History.htm| archivedate= 27 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1878 to 1969===
[[File:BT Tower-1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[BT Tower]], originally the Post Office Tower, constructed between 1961 and 1964]]
In January 1878 [[Alexander Graham Bell]] demonstrated his recently developed telephone to [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Linge&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=First helped put us in touch 135 years ago|last=Linge|first=Prof. Nigel|date=4 February 2013|work=Manchester Evening News|publisher=MEN Media|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the first telephone in Britain was installed, under licence from the General Post Office, by engineers from David Moseley and Sons, to connect the Dantzic Street premises of [[Manchester]] hardware merchant, Mr. John Hudson, with his other premises in nearby Shudehill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linge&quot; /&gt; As the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together. The first exchange was opened in London in August 1879, closely followed by the Lancashire Telephonic Exchange in Manchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linge&quot; /&gt; From 1878, the telephone service in Britain was provided by private sector companies such as the [[National Telephone Company]], and later by the General Post Office. In 1896, the National Telephone Company was taken over by the General Post Office. In 1912 it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services, after the Post Office took over the private sector telephone service in GB, except for a few local authority services. Those services all folded within a few years, the sole exception being [[Kingston upon Hull]], where the telephone department became present day [[KCOM Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

===Public corporation===
Converting the Post Office into a nationalised industry, as opposed to a governmental department, was first discussed in 1932 by Lord Wolmer. In 1932 the Bridgeman Committee produced a report that was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/btshistory/1912to1968/1932.htm|title=1912to1968|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, more proposals were ignored. The Post Office remained a department of central government, with the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] sitting in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

In March 1965, [[Tony Benn]], the acting [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], wrote to [[Harold Wilson]], the Prime Minister, proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the Post Office into a [[State ownership|nationalised industry]]. A committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal, and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the Government to re-establish a Steering Group on the Organisation of the Post Office. After some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions; [[General Post Office|Post]], Telecommunications, [[National Savings and Investments|Saving]]s, [[Girobank|Giro]] and National Data Processing Services, it was decided that there should be two: ''Post'' and ''Telecommunications''. These events finally resulted in the introduction of the Post Office Act, 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

On 1 October 1969, under the Post Office Act of 1969, the Post Office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a [[Public company|public corporation]]. The Act gave the Post Office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems. Effectively, the General Post Office retained its telecommunications monopoly.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

=== 1969 to 1982 ===
[[File:British Telecom 1981.svg|thumb|150px|The British Telecom &quot;T&quot; symbol logo, used from 1980 to 1991]]
In 1977, the Carter Committee Report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations. The findings contained in the report led to the renaming of [[Post Office Telecommunications]] as British Telecommunications (trading as British Telecom) in 1980, although it remained part of the Post Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

The [[British Telecommunications Act 1981]] transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the Post Office, creating two separate corporations, [[Post Office Ltd.]] and British Telecommunications. At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into British telecommunications industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British Telecommunications, to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems. Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the [[British Standards Institution]] (BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and had the effect of requiring British Telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems. The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable &amp; Wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary, [[Mercury Communications Ltd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/mercury-communications-ltd-history/ History of Mercury Communications] fundinguniverse.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982 to 1991===
On 19 July 1982, the Government formally announced its intention to privatise British Telecommunications with the sale of up to 51% of the company's shares to private investors. This intention was confirmed by the passing of the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]], which received Royal Assent on 12 April that year. The transfer to British Telecommunications plc of the business of British Telecommunications, the statutory corporation, took place on 6 August 1984 and, on 20 November 1984, more than 50 per cent of British Telecommunications shares were sold to the public. At the time, this was the largest share issue in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressandstar.com/days/1976-2000/1984.html Tory conference bombed] ''Express and Sta''r. Retrieved 24 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The new legislation was intended to enable British Telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in GB and to expand its operations globally. Commercial freedom granted to British Telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and, if it so decided, to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus. The company's transfer into the private sector continued in December 1991 when the Government sold around half its remaining holding of 47.6% of shares, reducing its stake to 21.8%. Substantially all the government's remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in July 1993, raising £5&amp;nbsp;billion for the Treasury and introducing 750,000 new shareholders to the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/8898538/Privatisation-shares-how-have-they-fared.html Privatisation shares – how have they fared?] ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 18 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Act also abolished British Telecommunications's exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition. This meant that British Telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems, which it had technically retained under the 1981 Act despite the Secretary of State's licensing powers. It now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator.  The principal licence granted to British Telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities, including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

In 1985, [[Cellnet]] was launched as a subsidiary of Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Limited, a 60:40 venture between British Telecommunications and [[G4S|Securicor]] respectively. Securicor originally invested £4&amp;nbsp;million in Cellnet in 1983. In 1999, BT purchased Securicor's shares in Cellnet for £3.15&amp;nbsp;billion. The company was later rebranded as BT Cellnet, and became a part of BT Wireless, a group of subsidiary companies owned by BT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/404792.stm | title= BT gobbles up Cellnet | date= 27 July 1999 | accessdate =1 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major development for British Telecommunications, and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications, occurred in 1991. On 5 March, the Government's [[White Paper]], &quot;Competition and Choice: Telecommunications Policy&quot; for the 1990s, was issued. In effect, it ended the duopoly which had been shared by British Telecommunications and [[Mercury Communications]] in the UK since November 1983 and the build-up to privatisation. The new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies. Independent &quot;retail&quot; companies were permitted to bulk-buy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users. The White Paper was endorsed by British Telecommunications, the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030859619190039E|title=Competition and choice in telecommunications: The Duopoly review consultative document|accessdate=15 March 2015 | doi=10.1016/0308-5961(91)90039-E|volume=15|journal=Telecommunications Policy|pages=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991 to 2001===
[[File:BT old logo.svg|thumb|150px|The BT brand and piper logo were introduced in 1991. The logo remained until 2003.]]
On 2 April 1991, the company started using a new trading name, BT, and branding.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

In June 1994, BT and [[MCI Communications|MCI Communication Corporation]], the second largest carrier of long distance telecommunications services in the United States, launched [[Concert Communications Services]], a $1&amp;nbsp;billion joint venture company. This alliance gave BT and MCI a global network for providing end-to-end connectivity for advanced business services. Concert was the first company to provide a single-source broad portfolio of global communications services for multinational customers. On 3 November 1996, BT and MCI announced they had entered into a merger agreement to create a global telecommunications company called Concert plc, to be incorporated in GB, with headquarters in both [[London]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] As part of the alliance BT acquired a 20% holding in MCI. Nevertheless, following US carrier [[WorldCom]]'s rival bid for MCI on 1 October 1997, BT ultimately decided in November, to sell its stake in MCI to WorldCom for $7&amp;nbsp;billion. The deal with WorldCom resulted in a profit of more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion on BT's original investment in MCI, with an additional $465&amp;nbsp;million severance fee for the break-up of the proposed merger.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

In December 2000, following modifications to BT's licence in April 2000, BT offered [[local loop unbundling]] (LLU) to other telecommunications operators, enabling them to use BT's copper local loops (the connection between the customer's premises and the exchange) to connect directly with their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silverlinings.eu/voice/telephone-lines/local-loop-unbundling/|title=Local loop unbundling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001 to 2006===
[[File:British Telecom offices in Madrid (Spain) 01.jpg|thumb|BT offices in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]
Following the [[dot com crash]], the group undertook a board restructuring and asset sale to address its large debts. In May 2001, BT announced a three-for-ten rights issue to raise £5.9&amp;nbsp;billion—still GB's largest ever rights issue—and the sale of [[Yell Group]], the international directories and associated e-commerce business, for £2.14&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellgroup.com/english/aboutyell-yelluk-yellukhistory-2000|title=Yell History – 2000+|publisher=Yell.com|accessdate=11 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both activities were completed in June 2001. The group also sold its property portfolio to [[Telereal Trillium|Telereal]], a property company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1386165.stm|title=BT hires demerger specialist|publisher=BBC News|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BT renamed its BT Wireless division as [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]] in September 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1522609.stm | title = BT unveils new mobile brand | date=3 September 2001 | accessdate=20 December 2014 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed it planned to demerge the unit in November that year. Shareholders approved the demerger at an [[extraordinary general meeting]] held in Birmingham in October 2001, with 4.297&amp;nbsp;billion British Telecommunications shares voted in favour, and 0.67&amp;nbsp;million voted against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1615100.stm | title = BT approves mobiles spin-off | date = 23 October 2001 | accessdate =1 April 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT Wireless demerged in 2001, and was relaunched on 18 June 2002 as O2. O2 was acquired by [[Telefónica]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/article/telefonica-says-it-has-no-plans-uk-float-o2|title=Telefónica says it has no plans for a UK float of O2|publisher=City AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2003, BT unveiled its current corporate identity, known as the &quot;Connected World&quot;, and brand values.&lt;ref name=indep8403&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bt-calls-up-a-new-logo-in-attempt-to-escape-from-arrogant-image-593715.html|title=BT calls up a new logo in attempt to escape from 'arrogant' image|accessdate=25 January 2012|work=The Independent |location=UK|date=8 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the aspirations of a technologically innovative future, the connected world is designed to embody BT's five corporate values: trustworthy, helpful, inspiring, straightforward, heart. The globe device part of the logo was originally designed by the [[Wolff Olins]] brand consultancy for BT's [[Concert Communications Services|Concert]] joint venture with [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]], and was subsequently used by BT's internet division, Openworld, prior to being adopted by the company as a whole.&lt;ref name=indep8403/&gt;

The Communications Act, 2003, which came into force on 25 July 2003, introduced a new industry regulator, the Office of Communications ([[Ofcom]]), to replace the Office of Telecommunications ([[Oftel]]). It also introduced a new regulatory framework. The licensing regime was replaced by a general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement and, in some instances, specific conditions.  Under a specific condition BT retained its universal service obligation (USO) for GB, excluding the Hull area. The USO included connecting consumers to the fixed telephone network, schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of call box services.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot; /&gt;

In the summer of 2004, BT launched Consult 21, an industry consultation for BT's 21st century network (21CN) programme. [[21CN]] is a next-generation network transformation, that, at one time, was due for completion by the end of 2010. Using internet protocol technology, 21CN will replace the existing networks and communications from any device such as mobile phone, PC, PDA, or home phone, to any other device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connectedplanetonline.com/home/news/bt_consulting_business_120606/|title=ITU: BT launches consulting business|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, BT was awarded the contract to deliver and manage N3, a secure and fast broadband network for the [[NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) program, on behalf of the [[English National Health Service]] (NHS).&lt;ref name=&quot;BT_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/government-computing-network/2010/dec/20/doh-extends-n3-deal-with-bt-20dec10 |title=DoH extends BT N3 deal |date=20 December 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 BT made a number of important acquisitions. In February 2005, BT acquired Infonet (now re-branded BT Infonet), a large telecoms company based in [[El Segundo, California]], giving BT access to new geographies. It also acquired the second largest telecoms operator in the Italian business market, Albacom. Then in April 2005, it bought Radianz from Reuters (now rebranded as BT Radianz), which expanded BT's coverage and provided BT with more buying power in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DUJ/is_/ai_n9772149 |title=BT goes home |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of its fibre broadband rollout, BT said it would deliver fibre-to-the-premises ([[FTTP]]) to around 25% of the Country, with the rest catered for by the slower fibre-to-the-cabinet (FTTC), which uses copper wiring to deliver the final stretch of the connection. In 2014, with less than 0.7% of the company's fibre network being FTTP, BT dropped the 25% target, saying that it was &quot;far less relevant today&quot; because of improvements made to the headline speed of FTTC, which had doubled to 80Mbit/s since its fibre broadband rollout was first announced.&lt;ref name=&quot;alphr.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title = BT aimed to get true fibre to 25% of UK.

On 6 April 2011, BT launched the first online [[not-for-profit]] fundraising service for [[United Kingdom|UK]] charities called [[BT MyDonate]] as part of its investment to the community. The service will pass on 100% of all donations made through the site to the charity, and unlike [[Comparison of online charity donation services in the United Kingdom|other services]] which take a proportion as commission and charge charities for using their services, BT will only pass on credit/debit card charges for each donation. The service allows people to register to give money to charity or collect fundraising donations. BT developed MyDonate with the support of [[Cancer Research UK]], [[Changing Faces (charity)|Changing Faces]], [[KidsOut]], [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] and [[Women's Aid Federation of England|Women's Aid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Smithers|first=Rebecca|title=Charitable giving: BT launches website where 100% of donations go to charity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/apr/06/charitable-giving-bt-donations-direct|accessdate=14 February 2016|newspaper=The Guardian |location=UK|date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warman|first1=Matt|title=BT launches MyDonate JustGiving donations rival|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8430512/BT-launches-MyDonate-JustGiving-donations-rival.html|accessdate=14 February 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Tara|title=BT launches charity giving service|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1719384/BT-launches-charity-giving-service.html|accessdate=14 February 2016|work=This is Money|date=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 2014, shares in BT rose considerably on the announcement that the company were in talks to buy back O2; while at the same time BT confirmed that it had been approached by [[EE Limited|EE]] to also buy that company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/24/bt-o2-talks-buy-back|title=BT in talks with Telefónica to buy O2|author=Simon Goodley|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT confirmed on 15 December 2014 that it had entered into exclusive talks to buy EE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 December 2014 |title=BT in talks to buy EE for £12.5bn |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30487285 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT confirmed on 5 February 2015 that it had agreed to buy EE for £12.5 billion, subject to regulatory approval.

On 15 January 2016, BT received final unconditional approval by the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] to acquire [[EE Limited|EE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = BT takeover of EE gets final Competition and Markets Authority clearance|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35320831|website = BBC News|accessdate = 15 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal was officially completed on 29 January 2016 with [[Deutsche Telekom]] now owning 12% of BT, while [[Orange S.A.]] own 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BT Group PLC Completion of the acquisition of EE Limited|url=http://www.4-traders.com/BT-GROUP-PLC-4003616/news/BT-Group-PLC-Completion-of-the-acquisition-of-EE-Limited-21767295/|accessdate=29 January 2016|work=4-traders|date=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2016, BT announced a new organisational structure that will take effect from April 2016 following the successful acquisition of [[EE Limited|EE]]. The EE brand, network and high street stores will be retained and will become a second consumer division, operating alongside [[BT Consumer]].

There will be a new BT Business and Public Sector division that will have around £5bn of revenues and will serve small and large businesses as well as the public sector in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It will comprise the existing [[BT Business]] division along with EE's business division and those parts of [[BT Global Services]] that are UK focused. There will also be another new division; BT Wholesale and Ventures that will comprise the existing [[BT Wholesale]] division along with EE's [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] business as well as some specialist businesses such as Fleet, Payphones and Directories. Gerry McQuade, currently Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Business at EE, will be its CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BT announces new structure|url=http://www.btplc.com/news/#/pressreleases/bt-announces-new-structure-1304769|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=BT News|publisher=BT Group PLC|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BT reports a 24% jump in quarterly profits amid revamp|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35457574|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=BBC News|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Kate|title=BT unveils management overhaul as it reports 'seven-year high' in revenue growth|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/telecoms/12133217/BT-unveils-new-structure-as-it-posts-best-revenue-growth-in-seven-years.html|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 February 2016, BT announced they will be launching a new free service later in 2016 to divert nuisance calls within its network before they ring on customers' phones and will use huge computing power to root out 25 million unwanted calls a week. BT customers can currently purchase special phones that will allow them to block nuisance calls or pay to stop calls getting through. However, the new service will identify some of the 5 billion unwanted calls made each year before they arrive, which will then be diverted automatically to a junk voicemail box. BT customers will also be able to add numbers they don't want to hear from to the blacklist, for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gompertz|first1=Simon|title=BT to divert nuisance calls for free|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-35545914|accessdate=12 February 2016|work=BBC News|date=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
[[File:BT Adastral Park, Ipswich, UK - geograph.org.uk - 39100.jpg|thumb|The [[Adastral Park]] campus at [[Martlesham Heath]] in Suffolk, the principal site of [[BT Research]].]]
BT Group is a [[holding company]]; the majority of its businesses and assets are held by its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc.&lt;ref name=Groupbusinesses&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|title=Group businesses|accessdate=20 December 2014|publisher=BT Group plc}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT's businesses are operated under special government regulation by the British telecoms regulator [[Ofcom]] (formerly [[Oftel]]). BT has been found to have significant market power in some markets following market reviews by Ofcom. In these markets, BT is required to comply with additional obligations such as meeting reasonable requests to supply services and not to discriminate.

BT runs the [[telephone exchange]]s, trunk network and [[local loop]] connections for the vast majority of British fixed-line telephones. Currently BT is responsible for approximately 28&amp;nbsp;million telephone lines in GB. Apart from [[KCOM Group]], which serves Kingston upon Hull, BT is the only UK telecoms operator to have a ''[[Universal service|Universal Service Obligation]],'' (USO) which means it must provide a fixed telephone line to any address in the UK. It is also obliged to provide public call boxes.

As well as continuing to provide service in those traditional areas in which BT has an obligation to provide services or is closely regulated, BT has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less regulation. These are principally, broadband internet service and [[bespoke]] solutions in telecommunications and information technology.

BT has the largest [[defined benefit pension plan]] of any UK public company.  The trustees valued the scheme at £36.7&amp;nbsp;billion at the end of 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btpensions.net/41/scheme-report-and-accounts|title=BT Pension scheme Report and Accounts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an actuarial valuation valued the deficit of the scheme at £9.043&amp;nbsp;billion as of 31 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Following a change in the regulations governing inflation index linking, the deficit was estimated at £5.2&amp;nbsp;billion in November 2010.&lt;ref name=DeficitFall&gt;{{cite news | url = http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bt-pension-deficit-falls-2-9bn-on-cpi-inflation-link-change-tele-4c5fdd6acc90.html | title = BT pension deficit falls £2.9bn on CPI inflation link change | accessdate =14 March 2011 | work= Yahoo News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sponsorships===

BT sponsored Scotland's domestic [[rugby union]] championship and cup competitions between 1999 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reid|first1=Alasdair|title=Scottish rugby's home renamed BT Murrayfield Stadium in £20m sponsorship deal with broadcasting giant|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/news/10861317/Scottish-rugbys-home-renamed-BT-Murrayfield-Stadium-in-20m-sponsorship-deal-with-broadcasting-giant.html|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=The TDaily elegraph|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scottish Rugby secures historic sports sponsorship with BT|url=http://www.scottishrugby.org/news/14/05/28/scottish-rugby-secures-historic-sports-sponsorship-bt|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=Scottish Rugby Union|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scottish Rugby confirms deal for BT Murrayfield Stadium|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/27605156|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=BBC Sport|date=28 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 July 2013, it was announced that BT had partnered up with [[Scottish Rugby Union]] in a four-year sponsorship deal with its two professional clubs; [[Edinburgh Rugby]] and [[Glasgow Warriors]] that will commence from August 2013. The deal involves [[BT Sport]] becoming the new shirt sponsor for both clubs as well as being promoted with BT Group at their respective home grounds; [[Scotstoun Stadium]] and [[Murrayfield Stadium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Telegraph&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rumsby|first1=Ben|title=BT Sport signs Glasgow and Edinburgh rugby shirt sponsorship deal circumventing Sky advertising ban|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/club/10208517/BT-Sport-signs-Glasgow-and-Edinburgh-rugby-shirt-sponsorship-deal-circumventing-Sky-advertising-ban.html|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scottish Rugby announces partnership with BT Sport|url=http://www.scottishrugby.org/news/13/07/29/scottish-rugby-announces-partnership-bt-sport|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=Scottish Rugby Union|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BT Sport announces partnership with Scottish Rugby|url=http://btplc.com/news/Articles/ShowArticle.cfm?ArticleID=F7AAF31C-09A0-4EA0-9E15-EE5101038916|accessdate=6 February 2016|work=BT Group PLC|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2014, it was announced that BT agreed a £20 million four-year sponsorship deal with [[Scottish Rugby Union]] which includes BT securing the naming rights for [[Murrayfield Stadium]] which becomes BT Murrayfield Stadium, become sponsor of the Scotland sevens team, become principal and exclusive sponsor of Scotland's domestic league and cup competitions from next season, taking over the role from [[The Royal Bank of Scotland Group]] (RBS), and become sponsor of Scottish Rugby's four new academies that aims to drive forward standards for young players who have aspirations to play professionally.

In April 2015, it was announced that as part of BT's current £20 million four-year sponsorship deal with [[Scottish Rugby Union]] that was announced in May 2014, BT has completed its sponsorship portfolio following an additional investment of £3.6 million for the 3 years remaining of its sponsorship deal, to become the new shirt sponsor for the Scotland national teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scottishrugby.org/news/15/04/14/bt-completes-scottish-rugby-portfolio-scotlands-front-shirt-sponsor|title=BT completes Scottish Rugby portfolio as Scotland's front of shirt sponsor|date=14 April 2015|publisher=Scottish Rugby|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental record ==
In 2004 the BT Group signed the world's largest renewable energy deal with [[npower (UK)|npower]] and [[Centrica|British Gas]], and now all of their exchanges, satellite networks and offices are powered by renewable energy.  BT is a member of the Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change. They signed a letter urging the government to do more to tackle this problem.  Janet Blake, head of global [[corporate social responsibility]] at BT, says that she would like to see incentives that find ways of rewarding those companies that focus on climate change by making investments in green business models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itweek.co.uk/business-green/analysis/2199869/interview-csr-delivers-2bn-bt|title=Home - Incisive Media|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BT has made it clear that it has an ambitious plan to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Societyandenvironment/Climatechange/Climatechange.htm |title=Climate change |publisher=BT Group |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its strategy includes steps to reduce the company's carbon footprint as well as those of customers, suppliers and employees. BT has actually pledged to achieve an 80% reduction by the year 2016, which will require further efficiency improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/ClimateChange/WhatsBTdoing/Visionandstrategy/index.htm |title=Climate change – BT's Vision and Strategy |publisher=BT Group |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Abuse of monopoly position and underinvestment in infrastructure===
BT have been accused of abusing their control of Openreach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ofcom seeks views on splitting BT and Openreach|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33547111|website = BBC News|accessdate = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; underinvesting in the UK's broadband infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UPDATE Sky Demand Ofcom Open UK Competition Inquiry into BT Openreach - ISPreview UK|url = http://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2015/06/sky-demands-ofcom-launch-uk-competition-inquiry-into-bt-openreach.html|website = www.ispreview.co.uk|accessdate = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; charging high prices and providing poor customer service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Broadband firms go to war with BT and Ofcom over competition|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/telecoms/11246963/Broadband-firms-go-to-war-with-BT-and-Ofcom-over-competition.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Openreach's services receive hundreds of thousands of complaints on an annual basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BT's Openreach slammed for phone and broadband connection delays|url = https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/29/bt-openreach-broadband-phone-delays-new-build|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 13 October 2015|first = Anna|last = Tims}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undermining of National Security===
Between 2010 and 2012 the UK intelligence community initiated an investigation aimed at [[Huawei]], the foreign supplier of BT's new fibre infrastructure with increasing urgency after the USA, Canada and Australia prevented the company from operating in their countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charles Arthur |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/oct/08/china-huawei-zte-security-threat |title=China's Huawei and ZTE pose national security threat, says US committee |work=The Guardian |date=8 October 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although BT had notified the UK government in 2003 of Huawei's interest in their £10b network upgrade contract, they did not raise the security implications as BT failed to explain that the Chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/security/383125/government-admits-slip-ups-in-bt-huawei-deal|title=Government admits slip-ups in BT-Huawei deal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 December 2012 David Cameron was supplied with an in-depth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding Huawei, and that the UK governmental, military, business community and private citizen's privacy may be under serious threat. Subsequently, BT's Infinity program and other projects are now under urgent review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cusick|first=James|title=China telecoms giant could be cyber-security risk to Britain|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/china-telecoms-giant-could-be-cybersecurity-risk-to-britain-8420432.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2013, British lawmakers concluded that BT should never have allowed the Chinese company access to the UK's critical communications network without ministerial oversight, saying they were 'deeply shocked' that BT did not inform government that they were allowing Huawei and ZTE, both foreign entities with ties to the Chinese military, unfettered access to critical national systems. Furthermore, ministers discovered that the agency with the responsibility to ensure Chinese equipment and code was threat-free was entirely staffed by Huawei employees. Subsequently, parliamentarians confirmed that in case of an attack on the UK there was nothing at this point that could done to stop Chinese infiltration attacking critical national infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sandle |first=Paul |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/06/07/uk-britain-telecoms-huawei-idUKBRE9550RP20130607 |title=Parliamentarians say Huawei-BT deal exposes flawed security controls &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=7 June 2013 |accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ZTE]], another Chinese company that supplies extensive network equipment and subscriber hardware to BT Infinity, is also under scrutiny after the US, Canada, Australia and the European Union declared the company a security risk to its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shead |first=Sam |url=http://www.zdnet.com/uk/huawei-and-zte-could-pose-security-and-business-threat-to-europe-says-eu-report-7000008751/ |title=Huawei and ZTE could pose security and business threat to Europe, says EU report |publisher=ZDNet |date=13 December 2012 |accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wide Web hyperlink patent ===
In 2001, BT discovered it owned a patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) which it believed gave it patent rights on the use of [[hyperlink]] technology on the [[World Wide Web]]. The corresponding UK patent had already expired, but the US patent was valid until 2006. On 11 February 2002, BT began a court case relating to its claims in a US federal court against the [[Internet service provider]] [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy Communications Corporation]].  In the case ''[[British Telecommunications Plc. v. Prodigy]]'', the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] ruled on 22 August 2002 that the BT patent was not applicable to web technology and granted Prodigy's request for [[summary judgment]] of non-infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nswscl.org.au/journal/51/Glen_Sauer.html |title=BT's &quot;Hyperlinking&quot; Patent Litigation Fails |publisher=Nswscl.org.au |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioural targeting===
In early 2008 it was announced that BT had entered into a contract (along with [[Virgin Media]] and [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]]) with the [[spyware]] company [[Phorm]] (responsible under their 121Media guise for the Apropos [[rootkit]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/apropos.shtml F-Secure Spyware Information Pages: Apropos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110220950/http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/apropos.shtml |date=10 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/peopleonpage.shtml |title=F-Secure Spyware Information Pages: PeopleOnPage |publisher=F-secure.com |accessdate=18 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524153535/http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/peopleonpage.shtml |archivedate=24 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; to intercept and analyse their users' click-stream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of Phorm's OIX advertising service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/25/phorm_isp_advertising/page2.html |title=ISP data deal with former 'spyware' boss triggers privacy fears |work=The Register |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/29/phorm_documents/ |title=How Phorm plans to tap your internet connection |work=The Register |date=29 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, known as &quot;[[behavioural targeting]]&quot; and condemned by critics as &quot;data pimping&quot;, came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested-parties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under UK law (RIPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23449601-details/Web+users+angry+at+ISPs%27+spyware+tie-up/article.do |title=Web users angry at ISPs' spyware tie-up |work=Evening Standard |location=London |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/04/phorm_ripa/ |title=Data pimping: surveillance expert raises illegal wiretap worries |work=The Register |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/17/phorm_fipr_illegal/ |title=Net think thank: Phorm is illegal |work=The Register |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fipr.org/080423phormlegal.pdf |title=The Phorm &quot;Webwise&quot; System – a Legal Analysis |format=PDF |accessdate=18 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522062819/http://www.fipr.org/080423phormlegal.pdf| archivedate= 22 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a more fundamental level, many have argued that the ISPs and Phorm have no right to sell a commodity (a user's data, and the copyright content of web sites) to which they have no claim of ownership. In response to questions about Phorm and the interception of data by the Webwise system [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]], credited as the creator of the World Wide Web protocol, indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history:

{{quotation|It's mine – you can't have it. If you want to use it for something, then you have to negotiate with me. I have to agree, I have to understand what I'm getting in return. I myself feel that it is very important that my ISP supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house. It supplies connectivity with no strings attached. My ISP doesn't control which websites I go to, it doesn't monitor which websites I go to.
|Sir Tim Berners-Lee, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cellan-Jones |first=Rory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7299875.stm |title=Web creator rejects net tracking |publisher=BBC News |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Alleged complicity with drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia===
In September 2012, BT entered into a $23 million deal with the US military to provide a key communications cable connecting [[RAF Croughton]], a US military base on UK soil, with [[Camp Lemonnier]], a large US base in Djibouti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=bb6b01958cbe2c2150d56ff874d2dac4&amp;_cview=0 |title=Contract Award Notice |publisher=Procurement Directorate, Defense Information Systems Agency |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Lemonnier is used as a base for American drone attacks in Yemen and Somalia, and has been described by ''The Economist'' as &quot;the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of Afghanistan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/news/international/21565614-america-uses-drones-lot-secret-and-largely-unencumbered-declared-rules-worries |title=Death From Afar |work=The Economist |date=3 November 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups including [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] and [[Amnesty International]] have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones. Evidence produced by [[The Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] and [[Stanford University]]'s International Human Rights &amp; Conflict Resolution Clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties, and may be illegal under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/07/02/resources-and-graphs/ |title=Pakistan Drone Statistics Visualised |publisher=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingunderdrones.org/ |title=Living Under Drones |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, BT was the subject of a complaint by [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] to the [[Department of Business, Innovation and Skills]] under the [[OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises]], following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2013_07_15_PUB_Complaint_to_UK_NCP_re_BT_plc.pdf |title=Complaint to UK National Contact Point |publisher=Reprieve |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in May 2014, on the basis that the UK National Contact Point's decision did not follow the OECD Guidelines. The issue of bias was also raised, due to the appointment of Lord Ian Livingston as government minister for the department which was processing the complaint: Livingston had occupied a senior position at BT when the cable between RAF Croughton and Camp Lemonnier was originally built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-minister-in-row-over-bts-link-to-us-drones-war-9215364.html |title=Minister in row over BT's link to US drones' war |work=The Independent |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of a series of articles about the differences between [[British English]] and [[American English]], which, ''for the purposes of these articles'', are defined as follows:

{{American and British English differences}}

*'''[[British English]]''' (BrE) is the form of [[English language|English]] used in the [[United Kingdom]]. It includes all English [[dialect]]s used in the United Kingdom.
*'''[[American English]]''' (AmE) is the form of English used in the [[United States]]. It includes all English dialects used in the United States.

Written forms of British and American English as found in newspapers and textbooks vary little in their essential features, with only occasional noticeable differences in comparable media&lt;ref&gt;Even in vocabulary. &quot;A British reader of ''Time'' or ''Newsweek'' would note distinctly American expressions only a few times on any page, matching the few distinctly British expressions an American reader of ''The Economist'' would note.&quot;

Edward Finegan in ''Language in the USA: Themes for the Twenty-first Century''. Eds Charles Albert Ferguson, Edward Finegan, Shirley Brice Heath, John R. Rickford (Cambridge University Press, 2004). p. 29.
See also: David Crystal, ''the Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language''] (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; (comparing American newspapers with British newspapers, for example). This kind of formal English, particularly written English, is often called &quot;[[standard English]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Standard English is essentially written, printed English, seen in the textbooks, newspapers, and periodicals of the world – and also, these days on the WWW. It is largely identical in its global manifestation; we must allow only for the small amount of variation in vocab, grammar and spelling which make up the differences between Am, Br, Aus and other 'regional' standards.&quot;

David Crystal, [http://www.davidcrystal.com/DC_articles/English9.pdf &quot;The Past, Present, and Future of World English&quot;] in Andreas Gardt, Bernd-Rüdiger Hüppauf, Bernd Huppauf (eds) ''Globalization and the future of German'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2004). p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NB: &quot;standard English&quot; as used to describe written ''and'' spoken international English is a more contentious usage.
:&quot;standard English: In Sociolinguistics, a much debated term for the VARIETY of English used as a communicative norm throughout the English-speaking world. The notion has become increasingly difficult to handle because of the emergence of differing national standards of usage (in vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation and spelling) in areas where large numbers of people speak English as a first or second language.&quot; {{sic}}

The spoken forms of British English vary considerably, reflecting a long history of dialect development amid isolated populations. In the United Kingdom, dialects, word use and accents vary not only between [[English English|England]], [[Mid-Ulster English|Northern Ireland]], [[Scottish English|Scotland]] and [[Welsh English|Wales]], but also within them. ''[[Received Pronunciation]]'' (RP) refers to a way of pronouncing standard English that is actually used by about two percent of the UK population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby |first=Terry |date=28 March 2007 |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/lifestyle/are-regional-dialects-dying-out-and-should-we-care-if-they-are-13428248.html |title=Are regional dialects dying out, and should we care if they are? |newspaper=Belfast Telegraph |accessdate=27 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815124730/http://www.bartleby.com/64/C001/057.html |archivedate=August 15, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains the accent upon which dictionary pronunciation guides are based, and for teaching English as a foreign language. It is referred to colloquially as &quot;the Queen's English&quot;, &quot;Oxford English&quot; and &quot;BBC English&quot;, although by no means do all graduates of the university speak with such an accent and the BBC no longer requires it or uses it exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RP: a Social Accent of English|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/case-studies/received-pronunciation/|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present monarch uses a hyperlect of the Queen's English.

Regional dialects in the United States typically reflect some elements of the language of the main immigrant groups in any particular region of the country, especially in terms of pronunciation and [[vernacular]] vocabulary. Scholars have mapped at least four major regional variations of spoken American English: Northern, [[Southern American English|Southern]], [[Midland American English|Midland]], and Western.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William; Sharon Ash; &amp; Charles Boberg. (2006). Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology and Sound Change. Berlin/New York: Mouton de Gruyter. ISBN 311-016746-8.

Retrieved 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[American Civil War]], the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the east led to dialect mixing and levelling, so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated in the eastern parts of the country that were settled earlier. Localized dialects also exist with quite distinct variations, such as in Southern Appalachia, Boston and the New York City area.

British and American English are the reference norms for English as spoken, written, and taught in the rest of the world, excluding countries where English is spoken natively such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Ireland]] and [[New Zealand]]. In many former [[British Empire]] countries where English is not spoken natively, British English forms are closely followed, alongside numerous AmE usages which have become widespread throughout the [[English-speaking world|Anglosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2151400/Unstoppable-rise-American-English-Study-shows-young-Britons-copying-US-writing-style.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Laura | last=Clark | title=Unstoppable rise of American English: Study shows young Britons copying US writing style | date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/14130942 | work=BBC News | title=Viewpoint: Why do some Americanisms irritate people? | date=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in many countries historically influenced by the United States where English is not spoken natively, American English forms are closely followed. Many of these countries, while retaining strong BrE or AmE influences, have developed their own unique dialects, which include [[Indian English]] and [[Philippine English]].

Chief among other native English dialects are [[Canadian English]] and [[Australian English]], which rank third and fourth in the [[Geographical distribution of English|number of native speakers]]. For the most part, Canadian English, while featuring numerous British forms alongside indigenous Canadianisms, shares vocabulary, phonology and syntax with American English, leading many to recognize ''[[North American English]]'' as an organic grouping of dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill and Hannah, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Australian English likewise shares many American and British English usages alongside plentiful features unique to Australia, and retains a significantly higher degree of distinctiveness from both the larger varieties than does Canadian English. [[South African English]], [[New Zealand English]] and the [[Hiberno-English]] of Ireland are also distinctive and rank fifth, sixth and seventh in the [[Geographical distribution of English|number of native speakers]].

==Historical background==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
The [[English language]] was first introduced to the [[Americas]] by [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]], beginning in 1607 in [[Jamestown, Virginia]]. Similarly, the language spread to numerous other parts of the world as a result of British trade and colonization elsewhere and the spread of the former [[British Empire]], which, by 1921, held sway over a population of 470–570 million people, approximately a quarter of the world's population at that time.

Over the past 400 years the form of the language used in the [[Americas]]—especially in the [[United States]]—and that used in the United Kingdom have diverged in a few minor ways, leading to the versions now occasionally referred to as American English and British English. Differences between the two include [[pronunciation]], [[grammar]], [[Lexis (linguistics)|vocabulary (lexis)]], [[spelling]], [[punctuation]], [[idiom]]s, and formatting of [[calendar date|date]]s and [[number]]s, although the differences in written and most spoken grammar structure tend to be much less than those of other aspects of the language in terms of mutual intelligibility. A small number of words have completely different meanings in the two versions or are even unknown or not used in one of the versions. One particular contribution towards formalizing these differences came from [[Noah Webster]], who wrote the [[Webster's Dictionary|first American dictionary]] (published 1828) with the intention of showing that people in the United States spoke a different dialect from Britain, much like a regional accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sokolowski|first1=Peter|title=Soop vs. Soup|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0028-soopsoup.html|website=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=4 January 2015|format=Video|quote=&quot;Noah Webster: the man who changed the way we spell... up to a point.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This divergence between American English and British English has provided opportunities for humorous comment, e.g., [[George Bernard Shaw]] has a character say that the United States and United Kingdom are &quot;two countries divided by a common language&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Krueger CL, Stade G, Karbiener K, Encyclopedia of British Writers: 19th and 20th Centuries Book Builders LLC Infobase Publishing ISBN 0816046700, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oscar Wilde]] that &quot;We have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, the language&quot; (''[[The Canterville Ghost]]'', 1888). [[Henry Sweet]] incorrectly predicted in 1877 that within a century American English, Australian English and British English would be mutually unintelligible. It may be the case that increased worldwide communication through radio, television, the Internet and [[globalization]] has reduced the tendency towards regional variation. This can result either in some variations becoming extinct (for instance, ''the wireless'', being progressively superseded by ''the radio'') or in the acceptance of wide variations as &quot;perfectly good English&quot; everywhere.

Although spoken American and British English are generally mutually intelligible, there are occasional differences which might cause embarrassment—for example, in American English a ''rubber'' is usually interpreted as a ''condom'' rather than an ''eraser'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macmillan Dictionary|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/rubber|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Lts|accessdate=30 September 2013|location=definition 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a British ''fanny'' refers to the female pubic area, while the American ''fanny'' refers to an ''ass'' (US) or an ''arse'' (UK). Likewise the Australian ''root'' means to have sexual intercourse whilst in American English it means to support someone for success.

==Grammar==

===Nouns===

====Formal and notional agreement====
In British English (BrE), [[English collective nouns|collective nouns]] can take either singular (''[[formal agreement]]'') or plural (''[[notional agreement]]'') verb forms, according to whether the emphasis is on the body as a whole or on the individual members respectively; compare ''a committee was appointed'' with ''the committee were unable to agree''.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Houghton Mifflin Company|title=The American Heritage Guide to Contemporary Usage and Style|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xb6ie6PqYhwC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=29 June 2014|year=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=0-618-60499-5|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''the Government'' always takes a plural verb in British civil service convention, perhaps to emphasise the principle of [[cabinet collective responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;''Instructions to Secretaries of Committees'', Cabinet Office, nd&lt;/ref&gt; Compare also the following lines of [[Elvis Costello]]'s song &quot;[[Oliver's Army]]&quot;: ''Oliver's Army is here to stay / Oliver's Army are on their way ''. Some of these nouns, for example ''staff'',&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; actually combine with plural verbs most of the time.

In American English (AmE), collective nouns are almost always singular in construction: ''the committee was unable to agree''. However, when a speaker wishes to emphasize that the individuals are acting separately, a plural pronoun may be employed with a singular or plural verb: ''the team takes their seats'', rather than ''the team takes its seats''. Such a sentence would most likely be recast as ''the team members take their seats''.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, James A. ''Grammar and Composition IV''. 3d ed. Pensacola: A Beka Book, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite exceptions such as usage in ''The New York Times'', the names of sports teams are usually treated as plurals even if the form of the name is singular.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The names of sports teams, on the other hand, are treated as plurals, regardless of the form of that name.&quot;[http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/plurals.htm#sports]&lt;/ref&gt;

The difference occurs for all nouns of multitude, both general terms such as ''team'' and ''company'' and proper nouns (for example where a place name is used to refer to a sports team). For instance,

{{quote|BrE: ''[[SuperHeavy]] is a band that shouldn't work'' or ''[[First Aid Kit (band)|First Aid Kit]] are a band full of contradictions'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Savage|first=Mark|title=Mick Jagger on SuperHeavy: 'Everyone subsumed their egos'|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-14901214|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sweeney|first=Sabrina|title=First Aid Kit: A band of contradictions|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-20407116|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AmE: ''[[The Clash]] is a well-known band''.&lt;br&gt;BrE: ''[[FC Red Bull Salzburg]] is an Austrian association football club''; AmE: ''The [[New York Red Bulls]] are an American soccer team''.}}

Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both AmE and BrE; for example, ''[[The Beatles]] are a well-known band''; ''[[New England Patriots|The Patriots]] are the champions'', with one major exception: in American English, ''the United States'' is almost universally used with a singular verb. Although the construction ''the United States are'' was more common early in the history of the country, as the singular federal government exercised more authority and a singular national identity developed (especially following the [[American Civil War]]) it became standard to treat ''the United States'' as a singular noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winik |first=Jay |title= April 1865: The month that saved America |year= 2001 |publisher=Harper |location=New York |pages=379. |isbn= 978-0-06-018723-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbs===

====Verb morphology====
{{See also|English irregular verbs}}

* The past tense and past participle of the verbs ''learn'', ''spoil'', ''spell'', ''burn'', ''dream'', ''smell'', ''spill'', ''leap'', and others, can be formed with ''-t'' (''learnt'', ''spoilt'', etc.) or with the regular ''-ed'' (''learned'', ''spoiled'', etc.). In BrE, both irregular and regular forms are current, but for some words (such as ''smelt'' and ''leapt'') there is a strong tendency towards the irregular forms, especially by users of [[Received Pronunciation]]. For other words (such as ''dreamed'', ''leaned'', and ''learned''&lt;ref&gt;Peters, pp. 165 and 316.&lt;/ref&gt;) the regular forms are somewhat more common. In most varieties of AmE, the ''-t'' forms are never or rarely used (except for ''burnt'').&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, pp. 15ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ''t'' endings may be encountered frequently in older American texts, especially poetry. Usage may vary when the past participles are used as adjectives, as in ''burnt toast''. (The two-syllable form ''learnèd'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɜːr|n|ɪ|d}}, usually written without the [[Grave accent|accent]], is used as an adjective to mean &quot;educated&quot; or to refer to academic institutions in both BrE and AmE.) Finally, the past tense and past participle of ''dwell'' and ''kneel'' are more commonly ''dwelt'' and ''knelt'' in both standards, with ''dwelled'' and ''kneeled'' as common variants in the US but not in the UK.
* ''Lit'' as the past tense of ''light'' is more common than ''lighted'' in the UK; American English uses ''lit'' to mean &quot;set afire&quot; / &quot;kindled&quot; / &quot;made to emit light&quot; but ''lighted'' to mean &quot;cast light upon&quot; (e.g., &quot;The stagehand ''lighted'' the set and then ''lit'' a cigarette.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, British English favours ''fitted'' as the past tense of ''fit'' generally, whereas the preference of American English is more complex: AmE prefers ''fitted'' for the metaphorical sense of having made an object [adjective-]&quot;fit&quot; (''i.e.'', suited) for a purpose; in spatial transitive contexts, AmE uses ''fitted'' for the sense of having made an object conform to an unchanged object that it surrounds (e.g., &quot;''fitted'' X around Y&quot;) but ''fit'' for the sense of having made an object conform to an unchanged object that surrounds it (e.g., &quot;''fit''[-past] X into Y&quot;); and for the spatial senses (both intransitive and transitive) of having been matching with respect to contour, with no alteration of either object implied, AmE prefers ''fit'' (&quot;The clothes [past-]''fit''.&quot;; &quot;The clothes [past-]''fit'' me well.&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The facts: there's no big difference in usage for &quot;forecasted&quot; or &quot;wedded&quot;; I have to check &quot;knit(ted)&quot; yet. What about broadcast(ed) instead?--&gt;
* The past tense of ''spit'' &quot;expectorate&quot; is ''spat'' in BrE, ''spit'' or ''spat'' in AmE.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; AmE typically has ''spat'' in figurative contexts, for example, &quot;He spat out the name with a sneer&quot;, or in the context of expectoration of an object that is not saliva, for example, &quot;He spat out the foul-tasting fish&quot; but ''spit'' for &quot;expectorated&quot; when it refers only to the expulsion of phlegm or saliva.
* The past participle of ''saw'' is normally ''sawn'' in BrE and ''sawed'' in AmE (as in ''sawn-off/sawed-off shotgun'').&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The past participle ''gotten'' is never used in modern BrE (apart from in dialects that retain the older form), which generally uses ''got'', except in old expressions such as ''ill-gotten gains''. According to the [[Compact Editions of the Oxford English Dictionary|Compact Oxford English Dictionary]], &quot;The form ''gotten'' is not used in British English but is very common in North American English.&quot; The American dictionary Merriam-Webster, however, lists &quot;gotten&quot; as a standard past participle of &quot;get.&quot; In AmE ''gotten'' emphasizes the action of acquiring and ''got'' tends to indicate simple possession (for example, ''Have you gotten it?'' versus ''Have you got it?''). ''Gotten'' is also typically used in AmE as the past participle for [[phrasal verb]]s using ''get'', such as ''get off'', ''get on'', ''get into'', ''get up'', and ''get around'': ''If you hadn't gotten up so late, you might not have gotten into this mess.'' AmE, but not BrE, has ''forgot'' as a less common alternative to ''forgotten'' for the past participle of ''forget''.
* AmE further allows other irregular verbs, such as ''dive'' (''dove'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dive Dive - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dive?s=t Dive | Define Dive at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''sneak'' (''snuck''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sneak Sneak - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sneak?s=t Sneak | Define Sneak at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and often mixes the [[preterite]] and past participle forms (''spring''–''sprang'', US also ''spring''–''sprung''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/spring?s=t Spring | Define Spring at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spring Spring - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes forcing verbs such as ''shrink'' (''shrank''–''shrunk'') to have a further form, thus ''shrunk''–''shrunken''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shrink?s=t Shrink | Define Shrink at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shrink Shrink - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These uses are often considered nonstandard; the [[AP Stylebook]] in AmE treats some irregular verbs as colloquialisms, insisting on the regular forms for the past tense of ''dive'', ''plead'' and ''sneak''. ''Dove'' and ''snuck'' are usually considered nonstandard in Britain, although ''dove'' exists in some British dialects and ''snuck'' is occasionally found in British speech.
* By extension of the irregular verb pattern, verbs with irregular preterits in some variants of colloquial AmE also have a separate past participle, for example, &quot;to buy&quot;: past tense ''bought'' spawns ''boughten''. Such formations are highly irregular from speaker to speaker, or even within [[idiolect]]s. This phenomenon is found chiefly in the northern US and other areas where immigrants of German descent are predominant and may have developed as a result of German influence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090307044026/http://www.bartleby.com:80/61/72/B0417200.html boughten. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Even in areas where the feature predominates, however, it has not gained widespread acceptance as standard usage.

====Use of tenses====
* In BrE, ''have got'' or ''have'' can be used for possession and ''have got to'' and ''have to'' can be used for the [[Modal verb|modal of necessity]]. The forms that include ''got'' are usually used in informal contexts and the forms without ''got'' in contexts that are more formal. In American speech the form without ''got'' is used more than in the UK, although the form with ''got'' is often used for emphasis. Colloquial AmE informally uses ''got'' as a verb for these meanings—for example, ''I got two cars'', ''I got to go''.
* In [[conditional sentences]] ''if'' clauses, possibly owing to the influence of German, US spoken usage often substitutes in the subordinate clause ''would'' and ''would have'' (usually shortened to ''[I]'d'' and ''would've'') for the simple past and for the pluperfect (''If you'd leave now, you'd be on time''. / ''If I would have [would've] cooked the pie we could have [could've] had it for lunch'' as opposed to ''If you left now, you'd be on time''. /  ''If I had cooked the pie we could have had it for lunch''). This tends to be avoided in writing because it is often still considered non-standard although such use of ''would'' is widespread in spoken US English in all sectors of society. Some reliable sources now label this usage as acceptable US English and no longer label it as colloquial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perfectyourenglish.com/writing/american-and-british-usage-2.htm |title=Conditional would is sometimes used in both clauses of an if-sentence. This is common in spoken American English. |publisher=Perfectyourenglish.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearson Longman, Longman Exams Dictionary, grammar guide:
It is possible to use ''would'' in both clauses in US English but not in British English: US: The blockades '''wouldn't happen''' if the police '''would be firmer''' with the strikers. Br: The blockades '''wouldn't happen''' if the police '''were firmer''' with the strikers.&lt;/ref&gt; (There are situations where ''would'' is used in British English too in seemingly counterfactual conditions, but these can usually be interpreted as a modal use of ''would'': ''If you would listen to me once in a while, you might learn something''.)&lt;ref name=&quot;lingua.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lingua.org.uk/eq&amp;a.html |title=NELL.links |publisher=Lingua.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.wordreference.com/showpost.php?p=5478593&amp;postcount=6 |title=To stress willingness of wish, you can use would or will in both clauses of the same sentence: If the band would rehearse more, they would play better.

* The &quot;[[English subjunctive|present subjunctive]]&quot; (morphologically identical with the bare infinitive) is regularly used in AmE in [[Subjunctive mood#English|mandative clauses]] (as in ''They suggested that he apply for the job''). In BrE, this usage declined in the 20th century in favour of constructions such as ''They suggested that he should apply for the job'' (or even, more ambiguously, ''They suggested that he applied for the job''). However, the mandative subjunctive has always been used in BrE, especially in formal writing.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 520 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Verbal auxiliaries====
*''Shall'' (as opposed to ''will'') is more commonly used by the British than by Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHBEU_p33&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = American Heritage editorial staff | title = The American Heritage Book of English Usage | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston | year = 1996 | isbn = 0395767865 |page=33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Shall and will#The prescriptivist distinction|prescriptions about the distinction]] exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHBEU_p33&quot;/&gt; ''Shan't'' is almost never used in AmE; rather, it is almost invariably replaced by ''won't'' or ''am/are/is not going to''. American grammar also tends to ignore some traditional distinctions between ''should'' and ''would'';&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090131155144/http://bartleby.com:80/64/C001/057.html § 57. should. 1.

:Except in the negative, the initial pronoun may be omitted in informal speech.

====Transitivity====
The following verbs show differences in [[transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] between BrE and AmE:
* ''agree'': Transitive or intransitive in BrE, usually intransitive (except with objective clauses) in AmE (''agree a contract''/''agree to'' or ''on a contract'', but ''I agree that this is a good contract'' in both). However, in formal AmE and BrE legal writing one often sees constructions such as ''as may be agreed between the parties'' (rather than ''as may be agreed ''upon'' between the parties'').
* ''appeal'' (as a decision): Usually intransitive in BrE (used with ''against'') and transitive in AmE (''appeal against the decision to the Court''/''appeal the decision to the Court'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=001611%23x1%23x1%23appeal&amp;selected_word=appeal&amp;search_word=appeal |title=Possible entries for appeal |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''catch up'' (&quot;to reach and overtake&quot;): Transitive or intransitive in BrE, strictly intransitive in AmE (''to catch somebody up''/''to catch up with somebody''). A transitive form exists in AmE, with a different meaning: ''to catch somebody up'' means that the subject will help the object catch up, rather the opposite of the BrE transitive meaning.
* ''cater'' (&quot;to provide food and service&quot;): Intransitive in BrE, transitive or intransitive in AmE (''to cater for a banquet''/''to cater a banquet'').
* ''cater to'' (&quot;to allow for a possibility&quot;): ''to cater to the speaker not turning up''.  A British speaker would probably recast the sentence.
* ''claim'': Sometimes intransitive in BrE (used with ''for''), strictly transitive in AmE.
* ''meet'': AmE uses intransitively ''meet'' followed by ''with'' to mean &quot;to have a meeting with&quot;, as for business purposes (''Yesterday we met with the CEO''), and reserves transitive ''meet'' for the meanings &quot;to be introduced to&quot; (''I want you to meet the CEO; she is such a fine lady''), &quot;to come together with (someone, somewhere)&quot; (''Meet the CEO at the train station''), and &quot;to have a casual encounter with&quot;. BrE uses transitive ''meet'' also to mean &quot;to have a meeting with&quot;; the construction ''meet with'', which actually dates back to [[Middle English]], appears to be coming back into use in Britain, despite some commentators who preferred to avoid confusion with ''meet with'' meaning &quot;receive, undergo&quot; (''the proposal was met with disapproval''). The construction ''meet up with'' (as in ''to meet up with someone''), which originated in the US,&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; has long been standard in both dialects.
* ''provide'': Strictly [[Monotransitive verb|monotransitive]] in BrE, monotransitive or [[Ditransitive verb|ditransitive]] in AmE (''provide somebody with something''/''provide somebody something'').
* ''protest'': In sense &quot;oppose&quot;, intransitive in BrE, transitive in AmE (''The workers protested against the decision''/''The workers protested the decision''). The intransitive ''protest against'' in AmE means &quot;to hold or participate in a demonstration against&quot;. The older sense &quot;proclaim&quot; is always transitive (''protest one's innocence'').
* ''write'': In BrE, the indirect object of this verb usually requires the preposition ''to'', for example, ''I'll write ''to'' my MP'' or ''I'll write ''to'' her'' (although it is not required in some situations, for example when an indirect object pronoun comes before a direct object noun, for example, ''I'll write ''her'' a letter''). In AmE, ''write'' can be used monotransitively (''I'll write my congressman''; ''I'll write him'').

====Complementation====
* The verbs ''prevent'' and ''stop'' can be found in two different constructions: &quot;prevent/stop someone ''from'' doing something&quot; and &quot;prevent/stop someone doing something&quot;. The latter is well established in BrE, but not in AmE.
* Some verbs can take either a to+infinitive construction or a [[gerund]] construction (for example, ''to start to do something''/''to start doing something''). For example, the gerund is more common:
** In AmE than BrE, with ''start'',&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 515.&lt;/ref&gt; ''begin'',&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; ''omit'',&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; ''enjoy'';&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;
** In BrE than AmE, with ''love'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=021990%23x1%23x1%23love&amp;selected_word=love&amp;search_word=love |title=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''like'',&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; ''intend''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presence (or absence) of syntactic elements===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
* Where a statement of intention involves two separate activities, it is acceptable for speakers of AmE to use ''to go'' plus bare infinitive. Speakers of BrE would instead use ''to go '''and''''' plus bare infinitive. Thus, where a speaker of AmE may say ''I'll go take/have a bath'', BrE speakers would say ''I'll go '''and''' take/have a bath''. (Both can also use the form ''to go '''''to'''''''&quot; instead to suggest that the action might fail, as in ''He went '''''to''''' take/have a bath, but the bathtub was full of children''.) Similarly, ''to come'' plus bare infinitive is acceptable to speakers of AmE, where speakers of BrE would instead use ''to come '''and''''' plus bare infinitive. Thus, where a speaker of AmE may say ''come see what I bought'', BrE speakers would say ''come '''''''and''''''' see what I've bought'' (notice the present perfect: a common British preference).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/go_1#go_1|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of prepositions before days denoted by a single word. Where British people would say ''She resigned on Thursday'', Americans often say ''She resigned Thursday'', but both forms are common in American usage. Occasionally the preposition is also absent when referring to months: ''I'll be here December'' (although this usage is generally limited to colloquial speech). The prepositions which are omitted in the original American text are supplied before it is re-published in most British publications. In teaching English lessons to children while they grow older the prepositions are almost always required in oral and written answers.
* In the UK, ''from'' is used with single dates and times more often than in the United States. Where British speakers and writers may say ''the new museum will be open from Tuesday'', Americans most likely say ''the new museum will be open starting'' or ''on Tuesday''. (This difference does not apply to phrases of the pattern ''from A to B'', which are used in both BrE and AmE.) A variation or alternative of this is the mostly American ''the play opens Tuesday'' and the mostly British ''the play opens on Tuesday''.
* American [[legislator]]s and lawyers always use the preposition ''of'' between the name of a legislative act and the year it was passed; their British counterparts do not. Compare ''[[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]'' to the ''[[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]]''. The year preceding the short title is also common (e.g. 19xx ''&lt;title of act&gt;'') in both systems when citing laws, but not widespread.

====Definite article====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
* A few 'institutional' nouns take no [[definite article]] when a certain role is implied: for example, ''at sea'' (as a sailor), ''in prison'' (as a convict), and ''at/in college'' (for students). Among this group, BrE has ''in [[hospital]]'' (as a patient) and ''at university'' (as a student), where AmE requires ''in '''the''' hospital'' and ''at '''the''' university'' (though AmE does allow ''in college'' and ''in school''). When the implied roles of patient or student do not apply, the definite article is used in both dialects. However, both variations drop the definite article with ''rush hour'': ''at rush hour'' (BrE)/''in rush hour'' (AmE).
* BrE distinguishes &quot;'''''in future'''''&quot; (&quot;from now on&quot;) from &quot;in '''''the''''' future&quot; (&quot;at some future time&quot;); AmE uses &quot;in '''''the''''' future&quot; for both senses.
* AmE usually omits, and BrE  usually  requires, the definite article in a few expressions{{Clarify|date=July 2008}} such as ''tell ('''''the''''') time'', ''play ('''''the''''') piano''.
* In BrE, numbered highways usually take the definite article (for example, &quot;the M25&quot;, &quot;the A14&quot;); in America, they usually do not (&quot;I-495&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;). [[Inland North American English|Upstate New York]], southern [[California English]], and Arizona are exceptions, where &quot;the 33&quot;, &quot;the 5&quot;, or &quot;the 10&quot; are the standard. A similar pattern is followed for named roads (for example, Strand in London is almost always referred to as ''the'' Strand), but in America, there are local variations, and older American highways tend to follow the British pattern (&quot;the Boston Post Road&quot;).
* AmE distinguishes &quot;in back of&quot; [behind] from &quot;in '''''the'''''  back of&quot;; the former is unknown in the UK and liable to misinterpretation as the latter. (Both, however, distinguish &quot;in front of&quot; from &quot;in  '''''the'''' front of&quot;.)
* Dates often include a definite article in UK spoken English, such as &quot;'''''the''''' eleventh of July&quot;, or &quot;July '''''the''''' eleventh&quot;; American speakers most commonly say &quot;July eleventh&quot;, and the form &quot;July eleven&quot; is now occasionally used by American speakers. However, the UK variants are also found in the US, even in formal contexts and especially among some speakers from rural [[New England]] and the [[Deep South]], perhaps influenced by other English variants, one example being &quot;the Fourth of July&quot;, [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] in the US.

===Prepositions and adverbs===
* British athletes play '''''in''''' a team; American athletes play '''''on''''' a team. (Both may play '''''for''''' a particular team.)
* In AmE, the use of the function word '''''out''''' as a preposition in '''''out the door''''' and '''''out the window''''' is standard to mean &quot;out through&quot;. For example, in AmE, one jumps &quot;out '''''of''''' a boat&quot; by jumping &quot;out the porthole,&quot; and it would be incorrect in standard AmE to &quot;jump out the boat&quot; or climb &quot;out of the porthole&quot; (although &quot;out of the porthole&quot; is used in certain Northeastern American dialects.) In BrE, ''out of'' is preferred in writing for both meanings, but ''out'' is common in some speech dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 186; Peters, pp. 400–401.&lt;/ref&gt; Several other uses of ''out of'' are peculiarly British (''out of all recognition'', ''out of the team''; cf. above);&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the New York City area, &quot;on line&quot; (two words) refers to the state of waiting in a line or queue; for example, standing on a sidewalk waiting for a table at a restaurant. Elsewhere in AmE, one waits &quot;in line&quot;. In BrE and AmE, going &quot;online&quot; (one word) refers to using the Internet. Usage of &quot;queue&quot; among Americans has increased in the last twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2581034/British-invasion-Americans-start-saying-Queue-thanks-Netflix-33-million-U-S-subscribers.html&lt;/ref&gt; In BrE, ''queue'' is the universal term and no variants of ''line'' are used in relation to waiting in turn. In BrE, people talk of standing in a queue, queuing up, joining the queue, sitting in a queue (for example, when driving) and simply queuing; Britons may be confused by the expression &quot;in line&quot;, thinking that a row rather than a column of people is meant.
* In AmE, the opposite of ''clockwise'' is ''counterclockwise''. This usage is not seen in BrE, which invariably uses ''anticlockwise''.
* To refer to an animal's [[oestrus|sexually receptive time]], the phrase ''on heat'' is heard in the UK (Regional Variation) but ''in heat'' in the US.
* The intransitive verb ''affiliate'' can take either ''with'' or ''to'' in BrE, but only ''with,'' or, in the case that &quot;affiliate&quot; is used as a noun, &quot;of&quot; (as in the phrase &quot;Microsoft is an affiliate of my company&quot;) in AmE.
* The verb ''enrol(l)'' usually takes ''on'' in BrE and ''in'' in AmE (as in &quot;to enrol(l) on/in a course&quot;) and the ''on/in'' difference is used when ''enrolled'' is dropped (as in &quot;I am (enrolled) on the course that studies....&quot;).
* In AmE, one always speaks of the street '''''on''''' which an address is located, whereas '''''in''''' BrE in can also be used in some contexts. ''In'' suggests an address on a city street, so a service station (or a tourist attraction or indeed a village) would always be '''''' ''on''''' a major road, but a department store might be '''''in''''' [[Oxford Street]]. Furthermore, if a particular place on the street is specified then the preposition used is whichever is idiomatic to the place, thus &quot;'''''at''''' the end of Churchill Road.&quot;
* BrE favours using the preposition ''at'' with ''weekend'' (&quot;at (the) weekend(s)&quot;); the constructions ''on'', ''over'' and ''during (the) weekend(s)'' are found in both varieties but are all more common in AmE than BrE.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, pp. 163 f.&lt;/ref&gt; See also ''Word derivation and compounds''. Similarly, BrE also favours using &quot;at&quot; with &quot;Christmas&quot;.{{clarify|date=October 2015|reason=makes it sound as though BrE does not use &quot;over&quot;, &quot;on&quot; or &quot;during&quot;, but the opposite is meant, i.e. that BrE uses all whereas AmE rarely uses &quot;at&quot;}}
* Adding ''at'' to the end of a question requesting a location is common in the southern states of the U.S. and in some British dialects, for example, &quot;where are you '''''at'''''?&quot;, but is not considered correct in standard American English and would be considered superfluous or humorous in standard BrE. However, some south-western British dialects use '''''to''''' in the same context; for example &quot;where are you '''''to''''?&quot;, to mean &quot;where are you '''''on''''' your journey?&quot;.
* In both dialects, '''''from''''' is the preposition prescribed for use after the word ''different'': ''American English is different from British English in several respects.'' However, '''''different ''''''than''''''''''' is also commonly heard in the US, and is often considered standard when followed by a clause&lt;ref&gt;https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/usage/different-from-than-or-to&lt;/ref&gt; (&quot;American English is different '''''than''''' it used to be&quot;), whereas ''different to'' is a common alternative in BrE, despite its informality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Partridge|title=Usage and Abusage|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|year=1947|chapter=Than, different|quote=The impeccably correct construction is ''different...from'' although ''different to'' is permissible}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/page/0,,184835,00.html|title=Guardian Style Guide|publisher=The Guardian|quote=different from or to, not different than|accessdate=2008-12-03|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is common in BrE to say ''opposite to'' as an alternative to ''opposite of'' when used as a noun, the only form normally found in AmE. The use of ''opposite'' as a preposition (''opposite the post office'') has long been established in both dialects but appears to be more common in British usage.
* The noun ''opportunity'' can be followed by a verb in two different ways: ''opportunity'' plus ''to''-infinitive (&quot;the opportunity to do something&quot;) or ''opportunity'' plus ''of'' plus gerund (&quot;the opportunity of doing something&quot;). The first construction is the most common in both dialects but the second has almost disappeared in AmE and is often regarded as a Briticism.
* Both British and Americans may say (for example) that a river is named ''after'' a state, but &quot;named ''for'' a state&quot; would rightly be regarded as an Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Concise Oxford English Dictionary, Luxury Edition |year=2011 |edition=12th |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-19-960111-0 |quote=(name someone/thing after or (N. Amer.) also for) call someone or something by the same name as: Nathaniel was named after his maternal grandfather. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* BrE sometimes uses ''to'' with ''near'' (''we live near to the university''); AmE avoids the preposition in most usages dealing with literal, physical proximity (''we live near the university''), although the ''to'' reappears in AmE (as in BrE) when ''near'' takes the comparative or superlative form, as in ''she lives nearer/nearest to the deranged axe murderer's house''.
* In BrE, one rings someone ''on'' their telephone number; in AmE, one calls someone ''at'' their telephone number.
* When referring to the constituency of an American legislator, the preposition &quot;from&quot; is usually used: &quot;Senator from New York,&quot; whereas British MPs are &quot;for&quot; their constituency: &quot;MP for East Cleveland.&quot;
* In AmE, the phrases ''aside from'' and ''apart from'' are used about equally; in BrE, ''apart from'' is far more common.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, p. 50; cf. [http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=001546%23x1%23x2%23apart%20from&amp;selected_word=apart%20from&amp;search_word=aside OALD].&lt;/ref&gt;
* In AmE, the compound &quot;off of&quot; may be used where BrE almost always uses &quot;off&quot;, and &quot;off of&quot; is considered slang. Compare AmE &quot;He jumped off of the box&quot; and BrE &quot;He jumped off the box&quot;. Even in AmE the &quot;of&quot; is best omitted for simplicity.
* In AmE ''absent'' is sometimes used as a preposition to introduce a prepositional phrase&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] |last1=Huddleston |first1=Rodney |last2=Pullum |first2=Geoffrey K. |year=2002 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0-521-43146-8 |page=610 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Absent any objections, the proposal was approved.''). The traditional equivalent in BrE would be ''In the absence of any objections, the proposal was approved''; this form is also common in AmE. In legal usage in BrE the shorter form has become more common, especially among lawyers with a Scots background.

====Phrasal verbs====
* Influenced by the German &quot;ausfüllen&quot;, in the US forms are usually but not invariably ''filled out'', but in Britain they are usually ''filled in''. However, in reference to individual parts of a form Americans may also use ''in'' (''fill in the blanks''). In AmE the direction ''fill it all in'' (referring to the form as a collection of blanks, perhaps) is as common as ''fill it all out''.
* Britons facing [[Rip-Off Britain|extortionate prices]] may have no option but to ''fork out'', whereas Americans are more likely to ''fork (it) over'' or sometimes ''up''; however, the ''out'' usage is found in both dialects.
* In both countries, [[Crime|thugs]] will ''beat up'' their victim; AmE also allows ''beat on'' (as both would for an inanimate object, such as a drum) or ''beat up on'', which are often considered slang.
* When an outdoor event is postponed or interrupted by rain, it is ''rained off'' in the UK and ''rained out'' in the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/learner-english/be-rained-off&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous grammatical differences===
* In names of American rivers the word ''river'' usually comes after the name (for example, ''[[Colorado River]]'') whereas for British rivers it comes before (as in ''the [[River Thames]]''). Exceptions in BrE include the ''[[Fleet River]]'', which is rarely called the ''River Fleet'' by [[Greater London|London]]ers outside official documentation, and also where the river name is an adjective (''the [[Yellow River]]''). Exceptions in the US are the ''[[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]]'' and the ''[[River Raisin]]'', both in [[Michigan]] and named by the French. The American convention is used in Australia, while convention is mixed in some Commonwealth nations, where both arrangements are often seen.
* In BrE speech, some descriptions of offices do not become titles (''Margaret Thatcher, the Prime Minister'' and ''Mr Jones, the team's coach''), while they do in AmE (''Prime Minister Thatcher'' and ''Coach Jones''). However the AmE pattern is sometimes found in BrE, usually in journalism.
* In BrE the word ''sat'' is often colloquially used to cover ''sat'', ''sitting'', and ''seated'': ''I've been sat here waiting for half an hour. The bride's family will be sat on the right-hand side of the church''. This construction is not often heard outside the UK. In the 1960s, its use would mark a speaker as coming from the north of England but by the turn of the 21st century this form had spread to the south. Its use often conveys lighthearted informality, when many speakers intentionally use a dialect or colloquial construction they would probably not use in formal written English. This colloquial usage is widely understood by British speakers. Similarly ''stood'' can be used instead of ''standing''. To an American and still to many Britons these usages are passive and may imply that the subject had been involuntarily forced to sit or stand or directed to hold that location.
* In a few areas of the Upper Midwest of the United States, the word ''with'' is also used as an adverb: ''I'll come with'' instead of ''I'll come along'', although it is rarely used in writing. ''Come with'' is used as an abbreviation of ''come with me'', as in ''I'm going to the office – come with'' by speakers in [[Minnesota]] and parts of the adjoining states, which had a large number of [[Scandinavian American|Scandinavian]], [[Dutch Americans|Dutch]] and [[German Americans|German immigrants]], who, when speaking English, translated equivalent phrases directly from their own languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/ct-tribu-words-work-midwest-20101208-story.html What's with 'come with'?], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', December 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; German and Dutch have [[separable verb]]s meaning to &quot;come with&quot;, ''mitkommen'' and ''meekomen''. It is similar to [[South African English]], where the expression comes from Afrikaans, a language of Dutch origin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IgsLAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=south+african+english+%22coming+with%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22coming+with%22 ''Africa, South and Southeast Asia''], Rajend Mesthrie, Mouton de Gruyter, 2008, page 475&lt;/ref&gt; These contractions are rarely used by native BrE speakers.
* The word ''also'' is used at the end of a sentence in AmE (just as ''as well'' and ''too'' are in both dialects) but not so commonly in BrE, although it is encountered in [[Northern Ireland]]. Additionally, the sentence-ending ''as well'' is more formal in AmE than in BrE.
* Before some words beginning with a pronounced (not silent) ''h'' in an unstressed first syllable, such as ''hallucination'', ''hilarious'', ''historic(al)'', ''horrendous'' and ''horrific'', some (especially older) British writers prefer to use ''an'' over ''a'' (''an historical event'', etc.).&lt;ref name=&quot;New Oxford&quot;&gt;New Oxford Dictionary of English, 1999, usage note for ''an'': &quot;There is still some divergence of opinion over the form of the indefinite article to use preceding certain words beginning with '''h'''- when the first syllable is unstressed: ‘'''a''' historical document’ or ‘'''an''' historical document’; ‘'''a''' hotel’ or ‘'''an''' hotel’. The form depends on whether the initial h is sounded or not: '''an''' was common in the 18th and 19th centuries because the initial h was commonly not pronounced for these words. In standard modern English the norm is for the '''h''' to be pronounced in words such as '''hotel''' and '''historical''' and therefore the indefinite article '''a''' is used; however the older form, with the silent '''h''' and the indefinite article '''an''', is still encountered, especially among older speakers.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; ''An'' is also preferred before ''hotel'' by some writers of BrE (probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from French, where the ''h'' is not pronounced, though it also fits the stress rule described—it is the second syllable that is stressed).&lt;ref name=Peterspg1&gt;[[Brown Corpus]] and [[Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen Corpus]], quoted in Peters (2004: 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The use of &quot;an&quot; before words beginning with an unstressed &quot;h&quot; is more common generally in BrE than American.&lt;ref name=Peterspg1/&gt; Such usage would now be seen as affected or incorrect in AmE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/determiners/determiners.htm#articles |title=Articles, Determiners, and Quantifiers |publisher=Grammar.ccc.commnet.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; American writers normally use ''a'' in all these cases, although there are occasional uses of ''an historic(al)'' in AmE.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, such use is increasingly rare in BrE too.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Oxford&quot;/&gt; Unlike BrE, AmE typically uses ''an'' before ''herb'', since the ''h'' in this word is silent for most Americans.

==Word derivation and compounds==
* Directional suffix ''-ward(s)'': British ''forwards'', ''towards'', ''rightwards'', etc.; American ''forward'', ''toward'', ''rightward''. In both dialects distribution varies somewhat: ''afterwards'', ''towards'', and ''backwards'' are not unusual in America; while in Britain ''forward'' is common, and standard in [[phrasal verb]]s such as ''look forward to''. The forms with ''-s'' may be used as adverbs (or preposition ''towards'') but rarely as adjectives: in Britain as in America, one says &quot;an upward motion&quot;. The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 1897 suggested a semantic distinction for adverbs, with ''-wards'' having a more definite directional sense than ''-ward''; subsequent authorities such as [[Fowler's Modern English Usage|Fowler]] have disputed this contention.
* AmE freely adds the suffix ''-s'' to ''day'', ''night'', ''evening'', ''weekend'', ''Monday'', etc. to form adverbs denoting repeated or customary action: ''I used to stay out evenings''; ''the library is closed Saturdays''. This usage has its roots in Old English but many of these constructions are now regarded as American (for example, the OED labels ''nights'' &quot;now chiefly N. Amer. colloq.&quot; in constructions such as ''to sleep nights'', but ''to work nights'' is standard in BrE).
* In BrE, the agentive ''-er'' suffix is commonly attached to ''football'' (also ''[[cricket]]''; often ''[[netball]]''; occasionally ''basketball'' and ''volleyball''). AmE usually uses ''football player''. Where the sport's name is usable as a verb, the suffixation is standard in both dialects: for example, ''[[golf]]er'', ''bowler'' (in [[Ten-pin bowling]] and in [[Bowls|Lawn Bowls]]), and ''[[Shooting sport|shooter]]''. AmE appears sometimes to use the BrE form in ''baller'' as slang for a basketball player, as in the video game ''[[NBA Ballers]]''. However, this is derived from slang use of ''to ball'' as a verb meaning to play basketball.
* English writers everywhere occasionally (and from time immemorial) make new compound words from common phrases; for example, ''health care'' is now being replaced by ''healthcare'' on both sides of the Atlantic. However, AmE has made certain words in this fashion that are still treated as phrases in BrE.&lt;!--example?--&gt;
* In [[English compound#Compound nouns|compound nouns]] of the form &lt;verb&gt;&amp;lt;noun&gt;, sometimes AmE prefers the [[Infinitive#Uses of the bare infinitive|bare infinitive]] where BrE favours the [[gerund]]. Examples include (AmE first): ''[[jump rope]]''/''skipping&amp;nbsp;rope''; ''racecar''/''racing car''; ''rowboat''/''rowing boat''; ''sailboat''/''sailing boat''; ''file cabinet''/''filing cabinet''; ''dial tone''/''dialling tone''; ''drainboard''/''draining board''. &lt;!-- the use of &quot;jump rope&quot; instead of &quot;skipping rope&quot; is much more complex than this rather simplistic explanation makes clear... not to mention that the actual British equivalent is &quot;jumping&quot; (not &quot;skipping&quot;) rope, because &quot;to jump&quot; is different from &quot;to skip&quot; --&gt;
* Generally AmE has a tendency to drop inflectional suffixes, thus preferring clipped forms: compare ''cookbook'' v. ''cookery book''; ''Smith, age 40'' v. ''Smith, aged 40''; ''skim milk'' v. ''skimmed milk''; ''dollhouse'' v. ''dolls' house''; ''barbershop'' v. ''barber's shop''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=008170%23x1%23x2%23cookbook&amp;selected_word=cookbook&amp;search_word=cookery |title='&amp;#39;Cookbook'&amp;#39; is now often used in BrE |publisher=Oup.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has recently been extended to appear on professionally printed commercial signage and some boxes themselves (not mere greengrocers' chalkboards): ''can vegetables'' and ''mash potatoes'' appear in the US.
* Singular attributives in one country may be plural in the other, and ''vice versa''. For example the UK has a ''drugs problem'', while the United States has a ''drug problem'' (although the singular usage is also commonly heard in the UK); Americans read the ''[[sports]]'' section of a newspaper; the British are more likely to read the ''sport'' section. However, BrE ''maths'' is singular, just as AmE ''math'' is: both are abbreviations of ''mathematics''.
* Some British English words come from French roots, while American English finds its words from other places, e.g.  AmE ''[[eggplant]]'' and ''[[zucchini]]'' are ''[[aubergine]]'' and ''[[courgette]]'' in BrE.

==Vocabulary==
{{see also|Lists of words having different meanings in American and British English|Glossary of American terms not widely used in the United Kingdom|Glossary of British terms not widely used in the United States}}
Most of the differences in lexis or vocabulary between British and American English are in connection with concepts originating from the 19th century to the mid 20th century, when new words were coined independently.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Almost the entire vocabularies of the car/automobile and railway/railroad industries (see Rail terminology) are different between the UK and US, for example. Other sources of difference are slang or vulgar terms (where frequent new coinage occurs) and idiomatic phrases, including phrasal verbs. The differences most likely to create confusion are those where the same word or phrase is used for two different concepts. Regional variations, even within the US or the UK, can create the same problems. From the mid-20th century, movies and television have spread new words in both countries, usually from the US to the UK.

It is not a straightforward matter to classify differences of vocabulary. David Crystal identifies some of the problems of classification on the facing page to his list of American English/British English lexical variation and states &quot;this should be enough to suggest caution when working through an apparently simple list of equivalents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal states one of the classification problems as

::&quot;We have to allow for words which have at least one [shared] meaning and one or more additional meanings that are specific to either AmE or BrE: an example is caravan, which in the sense of 'group of travellers in the desert' is common to both varieties; but in the sense of 'vehicle towed by a car' it is BrE (=AmE trailer)&quot;

David Crystal, The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of The English Language. 2nd Edition. (Cambridge University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview of lexical differences===

''Note: A lexicon is not made up of different words but different &quot;units of meaning&quot; (lexical units or lexical items e.g., &quot;fly ball&quot; in baseball), including idioms and figures of speech.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This makes it easier to compare the dialects.''

Though the influence of cross-culture media has done much to familiarize BrE and AmE speakers with each other's regional words and terms, many words are still recognized as part of a single form of English. Though the use of a British word would be acceptable in AmE (and vice versa), most listeners would recognize the word as coming from the other form of English and treat it much the same as a word borrowed from any other language.

====Words and phrases that have their origins in BrE====

Most speakers of AmE are aware of some BrE terms, although they may not generally use them or may be confused as to whether someone intends the American or British meaning (such as for ''[[biscuit]]''). It is generally very easy to guess what some words, such as &quot;driving licence&quot;, mean. However, use of many other British words such as ''[[Polari#Naff|naff]]'' (slang but commonly used to mean &quot;not very good&quot;) are unheard of in American English.

====Words and phrases that have their origins in AmE====

Speakers of BrE are likely to understand most common AmE terms, examples such as &quot;sidewalk&quot; (pavement), &quot;gas (gasoline/petrol)&quot;, &quot;counterclockwise&quot; (anticlockwise) or &quot;elevator (lift)&quot;, without any problem, thanks in part to considerable exposure to American popular culture and literature. Certain terms that are heard less frequently, especially those likely to be absent or rare in American popular culture, e.g., &quot;copacetic (satisfactory)&quot;, are unlikely to be understood by most BrE speakers.

====Divergence====

===== Words and phrases with different meanings =====

Words such as ''bill''  and ''biscuit'' are used regularly in both AmE and BrE but mean different things in each form.  In AmE a bill is usually paper money (as in &quot;dollar bill&quot;) though it can mean the same as in BrE, an invoice (as in &quot;the repair bill was £250&quot;).  In AmE a biscuit is what in BrE is called a scone.  In BrE a biscuit is what AmE calls a cookie.  As chronicled by [[Winston Churchill]], the opposite meanings of the verb ''[[Table (verb)|to table]]'' created a misunderstanding during a meeting of the Allied forces;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Second World War, Volume 3: The Grand Alliance |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill |year=1948–1954 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=978-0141441740}}&lt;/ref&gt; in BrE to table an item on an agenda means to ''open it up'' for discussion whereas in AmE, it means to ''remove'' it from discussion, or at times, to suspend or delay discussion.

The word &quot;football&quot; in BrE refers to [[Association football]], also known as [[Names for association football|soccer]]. In AmE, &quot;football&quot; means [[American football]]. The standard AmE term &quot;soccer&quot;, a contraction of &quot;association (football)&quot;, is of British origin, derived from the formalization of different codes of football in the 19th century, and was a fairly unremarkable usage (possibly marked for class) in BrE until relatively recently; it has lately become perceived incorrectly as an Americanism. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In international (i.e. non-American) context, particularly in sports news outside English-speaking North America, American (or US branches of foreign) news agencies also use &quot;football&quot; to mean &quot;soccer&quot;, especially in direct quotes.

Similarly, the word &quot;hockey&quot; in BrE refers to [[field hockey]] and in AmE, &quot;hockey&quot; means [[ice hockey]].

=====Other ambiguity (complex cases)=====

Words with [[List of words having different meanings in British and American English|completely different meanings]] are relatively few; most of the time there are either (1) words with one or more shared meanings and one or more meanings unique to one variety (for example, bathroom and toilet) or (2) words the meanings of which are actually common to both BrE and AmE but that show differences in frequency, connotation or denotation (for example, ''smart'', ''clever'', ''mad'').

Some differences in usage and/or meaning can cause confusion or embarrassment. For example the word ''fanny'' is a slang word for [[vulva]] in BrE but means [[buttocks]] in AmE—the AmE phrase ''[[fanny pack]]'' is ''bum bag'' in BrE. In AmE the word ''fag'' (short for ''[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]'') is a highly offensive term for a homosexual male but in BrE it is a normal and well-used term for a cigarette, for hard work, or for a chore, while a [[Faggot (food)|faggot]] itself is a sort of [[meatball]]. In AmE the word ''pissed'' means being annoyed whereas in BrE it is a coarse word for being drunk (in both varieties, ''pissed off'' means irritated).

Similarly, in AmE the word ''pants'' is the common word for the BrE ''trousers'' and ''knickers'' refers to a variety of half-length trousers (though most AmE users would use the term &quot;shorts&quot; rather than knickers), while the majority of BrE speakers would understand ''pants'' to mean ''underpants'' and ''knickers'' to mean ''female underpants''.

Sometimes the confusion is more subtle. In AmE the word ''quite'' used as a qualifier is generally a reinforcement: for example, &quot;I'm quite hungry&quot; means &quot;I'm very hungry&quot;. In BrE ''quite'' (which is much more common in conversation) may have this meaning, as in &quot;quite right&quot; or &quot;quite mad&quot;, but it more commonly means &quot;somewhat&quot;, so that in BrE &quot;I'm quite hungry&quot; can mean &quot;I'm somewhat hungry&quot;. This divergence of use can lead to misunderstanding.

====Frequency====
* In the UK the word ''whilst'' is historically acceptable as a conjunction (as an alternative to ''while'', especially prevalent in some dialects). In AmE only ''while'' is used in both contexts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Other conjunctions with the ''-st'' ending are also found even in AmE as much as in BrE, despite being old-fashioned or an affection.  ''Whilst'' tends to appear in non-temporal senses, as when used to point up a contrast.
* In the UK generally the term ''fall'' meaning &quot;[[autumn]]&quot; is [[obsolete]]. Although found often from [[English literature#Elizabethan era|Elizabethan literature]] to [[Victorian literature]], continued understanding of the word is usually ascribed to its continued use in America.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
*In the UK the term ''period'' for a [[full stop]] is not used; in AmE the term ''full stop'' is rarely, if ever, used for the punctuation mark. For example, [[Tony Blair]] said, &quot;Terrorism is wrong, full stop&quot;, whereas in AmE, &quot;Terrorism is wrong, period.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page7999.asp |title=PM's Press Conference |publisher=[[10 Downing Street]] |date=26 July 2005 |accessdate=2007-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416015348/http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page7999.asp |archivedate=16 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the interjection: ''period'' to mean ''&quot;and nothing else; end of discussion&quot;'' is beginning to be used in colloquial British English, though sometimes without conscious reference to punctuation.

====In fiction====
In the 2016 movie ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', set in the fictional ''[[Harry Potter]]'' universe, the word for a person who lacks magical ability is &quot;[[muggle]]&quot; in BrE and &quot;no-maj&quot; in AmE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Kerr-Dineen |first=Luke |date=2015-11-06 |title=J.K. Rowling revealed the American word for 'muggle' and people are furious about it |url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/11/j-k-rowling-revealed-the-american-word-for-muggle-and-people-are-furious-about-it |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |location= |access-date=2016-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has a more uniform nationwide system of terms than does the U.K., but the division by grades varies somewhat among the states and even among local school districts. For example, ''elementary school'' often includes kindergarten, and may include sixth grade, with ''middle school'' including only two grades or extending to ninth grade.

In the UK the US equivalent of a ''high school'' is often referred to as a &quot;secondary school&quot; regardless of whether it is state funded or private. Secondary education in the United States also includes ''middle school'' or ''junior high school'', a two- or three-year transitional school between elementary school and high school. &quot;Middle school&quot; is sometimes used in the UK as a synonym for the younger ''junior school'', covering the second half of the primary curriculum—current years four to six in some areas. However, in [[Dorset|Dorset (South England)]] it is used to describe the second school in the three-tier system, which is normally from year five to year eight. In other regions, such as [[Evesham]] and the surrounding area in [[Worcestershire]], the second tier goes from year six to year eight, and both starting secondary school in year nine. In Kirklees, West Yorkshire in the villages of the Dearne Valley there is a three tier system: first schools year reception to year five, middle school (Scissett/Kirkburton Middle School) year six to year eight and high school (&lt;ref&gt;Shelley College&lt;/ref&gt;)year 9 to year 13.

A ''public school'' has opposite meanings in the two countries. In AmE this is a government-owned institution open to all students, supported by public funding. The BrE use of the term is in the context of &quot;private&quot; education, i.e., to be educated privately with a tutor.&lt;ref&gt;^ &quot;public education&quot;. Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. 1971. &quot;=PUBLIC 4b.&lt;/ref&gt; In England and Wales the term strictly refers to an ill-defined group of prestigious [[Independent school (UK)|private independent schools]] funded by students' fees, although it is often more loosely used to refer to any independent school. Independent schools are also known as &quot;private schools&quot;, and the latter is the term used in Scotland and [[Northern Ireland]] for all such fee-funded schools. Strictly, the term ''public school'' is not used in Scotland and Northern Ireland in the same sense as in England, but nevertheless [[Gordonstoun]], the Scottish private school, is sometimes referred to as a ''public school'', as are some other Scottish private schools. Government-funded schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland are properly referred to as &quot;state schools&quot;—but are sometimes confusingly referred to as &quot;public schools&quot; (with the same meaning as in the US); whereas in the US, where most public schools are administered by local governments, a ''state school'' is typically [[State university system|a college or university]] run by one of the [[U.S. state|states]].

Speakers in both the United States and the United Kingdom use several additional terms for specific types of secondary school. A US ''prep school'' or ''[[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]]'' is an independent school funded by tuition fees; the same term is used in the UK for a [[preparatory school (UK)|private school for pupils under thirteen]], designed to prepare them for fee-paying public schools. An American ''[[catholic school]]s'' cover costs through tuition and have affiliations with a religious institution, most often a [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] church or diocese. In England, where the state-funded [[Education in the United Kingdom|education system]] grew from parish schools organized by the local [[established church]], the [[Church of England]] (C. of E., or C.E.), and many schools, especially [[Primary education|primary schools]] (up to age 11) retain a church connection and are known as ''[[faith school#United Kingdom|church schools]]'', ''C.E. schools'' or ''C.E. (aided) schools''. There are also ''faith schools'' associated with the Roman Catholic Church and other major faiths, with a mixture of funding arrangements.

In the US, a ''[[magnet school]]'' receives government funding and has special admission requirements: in some cases pupils gain admission through superior performance on admission tests, while other magnet schools admit students through a lottery. The UK has [[Academy (English school)|city academies]], which are independent privately sponsored schools run with public funding and which can select up to 10% of pupils by [[aptitude]]. Moreover in the UK 36 local education authorities retain selection by ability at 11. They maintain [[grammar school]]s (state funded secondary schools), which admit pupils according to performance in an examination (known as the 11+) and comprehensive schools that take pupils of all abilities. Grammar schools select the most academically able 10% to 23% of those who sit the exam. Students who fail the exam go to a [[secondary modern school]], sometimes called a &quot;high school&quot;, or increasingly an &quot;academy&quot;. In areas where there are no grammar schools the comprehensives likewise may term themselves high schools or academies. Nationally only 6% of pupils attend grammar schools, mainly in [[List of grammar schools in England|four distinct counties]]. Some private schools are called &quot;grammar schools&quot;, chiefly those that were grammar schools long before the advent of state education.

=====University=====

In the UK a university student is said to &quot;study&quot;, to &quot;read&quot; or, informally, simply to &quot;do&quot; a subject. In the recent past the expression 'to read a subject' was more common at the older universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. In the US a student ''studies'' or ''majors in'' a subject (although ''concentration'' or ''emphasis'' is also used in some US colleges or universities to refer to the major subject of study). ''To major in'' something refers to the student's principal course of study; ''to study'' may refer to any class being taken.

BrE:

{{quote|&quot;She read biology at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;She studied biology at Cambridge.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;She did biology at Cambridge.&quot; (''informal'')}}

AmE:

{{quote|
&quot;She majored in biology at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;She studied biology at Harvard.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;She concentrated in biology at Harvard.&quot;}}

At university level in BrE, each ''module'' is taught or facilitated by a ''[[lecturer]]'' or ''tutor''; ''professor'' is the job-title of a [[Professor#Most English-speaking countries|senior academic]] (in AmE, at some universities, the equivalent of the BrE lecturer is instructor, especially when the teacher has a lesser degree or no university degree, though the usage may become confusing according to whether the subject being taught is considered technical or not; it is also different from adjunct instructor/professor). In AmE each ''class'' is generally taught by a ''professor'' (although some US tertiary educational institutions follow the BrE usage), while the position of ''lecturer'' is occasionally given to individuals hired on a temporary basis to teach one or more classes and who may or may not have a doctoral degree.

The word ''course'' in American use typically refers to the study of a restricted topic or individual subject (for example, &quot;a course in Early Medieval England&quot;, &quot;a course in integral calculus&quot;) over a limited period of time (such as a semester or term) and is equivalent to a ''module'' or sometimes ''unit'' at a British university. In the UK, a ''course of study'' or simply ''course'' is likely to refer to the entire programme of study, which may extend over several years and be made up of any number of ''modules,'' hence it is also practically synonymous to a degree programme. A few university-specific exceptions exist: for example, at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] the word ''paper'' is used to refer to a ''module'', while the whole course of study is called ''tripos''.

A ''dissertation'' in AmE refers to the final written product of a doctoral student to fulfil the requirement of that program.  In BrE, the same word refers to the final written product of a student in an undergraduate or taught master's programme.  A dissertation in the AmE sense would be a thesis in BrE, though ''dissertation'' is also used.

Another source of confusion is the different usage of the word ''college''. (See a full international discussion of the various meanings at [[college]].) In the US this refers to a post-high school institution that grants either associate's or bachelor's degrees, while in the UK it refers to any post-secondary institution that is not a university (including ''sixth form college'' after the name in secondary education for years 12 and 13, the ''sixth form'') where intermediary courses such as [[Advanced Level (UK)|A levels]] or [[NVQ]]s can be taken and [[GCSE]] courses can be retaken. College may sometimes be used in the UK or in Commonwealth countries as part of the name of a secondary or high school (for example, [[Dubai College]]). In the case of Oxford, Cambridge, [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], [[University of London|London]], [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]], [[Durham University|Durham]], [[University of Kent|Kent]] and [[University of York|York]] universities, all members are also members of a college which is part of the university, for example, one is a member of [[King's College, Cambridge]] and hence the university.

In both the US and UK ''college'' can refer to some division within a university that comprises related academic departments such as the &quot;college of business and economics&quot; though in the UK &quot;faculty&quot; is more often used. Institutions in the US that offer two to four years of post-high school education often have the word ''college'' as part of their name, while those offering more advanced degrees are called a ''university''. (There are exceptions: [[Boston College]], [[Dartmouth College]] and [[the College of William &amp; Mary]] are examples of colleges that offer advanced degrees, while [[Vincennes University]] is an unusual example of a &quot;university&quot; that offers only associate degrees in the vast majority of its academic programs.) American students who pursue a ''bachelor's degree'' (four years of higher education) or an ''associate degree'' (two years of higher education) are ''college students'' regardless of whether they attend a college or a university and refer to their educational institutions informally as ''colleges.'' A student who pursues a master's degree or a doctorate degree in the arts and sciences is in AmE a ''graduate student''; in BrE a ''postgraduate student'' although ''graduate student'' is also sometimes used. Students of advanced professional programs are known by their field (''business student'', ''law student'', ''medical student''). Some universities also have a [[residential college]] system, the details of which may vary but generally involve common living and dining spaces as well as college-organized activities. Nonetheless, when it comes to the '''level''' of education, AmE generally uses the word ''college'' (e.g., going to college) whereas BrE generally uses the word ''university'' (e.g., going to university) regardless of the institution's official designation/status in both countries.

In the context of higher education, the word ''school'' is used slightly differently in BrE and AmE.  In BrE, except for the University of London, the word school is used to refer to an academic department in a university.  In AmE, the word school is used to refer to a collection of related academic departments and is headed by a dean.  When referring to a division of a university, school is practically synonymous to a college.

&quot;Professor&quot; has different meanings in BrE and AmE. In BrE it is the highest [[academic rank]], followed by reader, senior lecturer and lecturer. In AmE &quot;professor&quot; refers to academic staff of all ranks, with (full) professor (largely equivalent to the UK meaning) followed by associate professor and assistant professor.&lt;!-- why capitalize? not referring to any particular assistant professor, such as Assistant Professor Johnsondaleburgerschnitzle. --- Generally one wouldn't capitalize these in running text, but the other choice given that they are being referred to as words rather than used as words would be to put each of the titles into quotation marks, which seems even more obtrusive.cig-nifyer--&gt;

&quot;Tuition&quot; has traditionally had separate meaning in each variation. In BrE it is the educational content transferred from teacher to student at a university. In AmE it is the money (the fees) paid to receive that education (BrE: [[Tuition payments|tuition fees]]).

=====General terms=====

In both the US and the UK, a student ''takes'' an exam, but in BrE a student can also be said to ''sit'' an exam. When preparing for an exam students ''revise'' (BrE)/''review'' (AmE) what they have studied; the BrE idiom ''to revise for'' has the equivalent ''to review for'' in AmE.

Examinations are supervised by ''invigilators'' in the UK and ''proctors'' (or ''(exam) supervisors'') in the US (a ''proctor'' in the UK is an official responsible for student discipline at the University of Oxford or Cambridge). In the UK a teacher ''sets'' an exam, while in the US, a teacher ''writes'' (prepares) and then ''gives'' (administers) an exam.

BrE:

{{quote|&quot;I sat my Spanish exam yesterday.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I plan to set a difficult exam for my students, but I don't have it ready yet.&quot;}}

AmE:

{{quote|&quot;I took my exams at [[Yale]].&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I spent the entire day yesterday writing the exam. I'm almost ready to give it to my students.&quot;}}

In BrE, students are awarded ''marks'' as credit for requirements (e.g., tests, projects) while in AmE, students are awarded ''points'' or &quot;grades&quot; for the same. Similarly, in BrE, a candidate's work is being ''marked'', while in AmE it is said to be ''graded'' to determine what mark or grade is given.

There is additionally a difference between American and British usage in the word ''school''. In British usage &quot;school&quot; by itself refers only to primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools and to ''sixth forms'' attached to secondary schools—if one &quot;goes to school&quot;, this type of institution is implied. By contrast an American student at a university may talk of &quot;going to school&quot; or &quot;being in school&quot;. US and British law students and medical students commonly speak in terms of going to &quot;law school&quot; and &quot;med[ical] school&quot;, respectively. However, the word is used in BrE in the context of higher education to describe a division grouping together several related subjects within a university, for example a &quot;School of European Languages&quot; containing ''departments'' for each language and also in the term &quot;art school&quot;. It is also the name of some of the constituent colleges of the University of London, for example, [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[London School of Economics]].

Among high-school and college students in the United States, the words ''freshman'' (or the gender-neutral terms ''frosh'' or ''first year'', sometimes ''freshie''), ''sophomore'', ''junior'' and ''senior'' refer to the first, second, third, and fourth years respectively. For first-year students, &quot;frosh&quot; and &quot;freshie&quot; are another gender-neutral terms that can be used as a qualifier, for example &quot;Frosh class elections&quot;. It is important that the context of either high school or college first be established or else it must be stated directly (that is, ''She is a high school freshman''. ''He is a college junior.''). Many institutes in both countries also use the term ''first-year'' as a gender-neutral replacement for ''freshman'', although in the US this is recent usage, formerly referring only to those in the first year as a graduate student. One exception is the [[University of Virginia]]; since its founding in 1819 the terms &quot;first-year&quot;, &quot;second-year&quot;, &quot;third-year&quot;, and &quot;fourth-year&quot; have been used to describe undergraduate university students. At the [[United States service academies]], at least those operated by the federal government directly, a different terminology is used, namely &quot;fourth class&quot;, &quot;third class&quot;, &quot;second class&quot; and &quot;first class&quot; (the order of numbering being the reverse of the number of years in attendance). In the UK first-year university students are sometimes called ''freshers'' early in the academic year; however, there are no specific names for those in other years nor for school pupils. Graduate and professional students in the United States are known by their year of study, such as a &quot;second-year medical student&quot; or a &quot;fifth-year doctoral candidate.&quot; Law students are often referred to as &quot;1L&quot;, &quot;2L&quot;, or &quot;3L&quot; rather than &quot;nth-year law students&quot;; similarly, medical students are frequently referred to as &quot;M1&quot;, &quot;M2&quot;, &quot;M3&quot;, or &quot;M4&quot;.

While anyone in the US who finishes studying at any educational institution by passing relevant examinations is said to ''graduate'' and to be a ''graduate'', in the UK only degree and above level students can ''graduate''. ''Student'' itself has a wider meaning in AmE, meaning any person of any age studying at any educational institution or level, whereas in BrE it tends to be used for people studying at a post-secondary educational institution and the term ''pupil'' is more widely used for a young person at primary or secondary school, though the use of &quot;student&quot; for secondary school pupils in the UK is increasingly used, particularly for &quot;sixth form&quot; (years 12 and 13).

The names of individual institutions can be confusing. There are several &quot;University High Schools&quot; in the United States that are not affiliated with any post-secondary institutions and cannot grant degrees, and there is one public high school, [[Central High School of Philadelphia]], which does grant bachelor's degrees to the top ten per cent of graduating seniors. British secondary schools occasionally have the word &quot;college&quot; in their names.

When it comes to the admissions process, applicants are usually asked to solicit ''letters of reference'' or reference forms from referees in BrE.  In AmE, these are called ''letters of recommendation'' or recommendation forms.  Consequently, the writers of these letters are known as ''referees'' and ''recommenders'', respectively.

In the context of education, for AmE, the word ''staff'' mainly refers to school personnel who are neither administrators nor have teaching loads or academic responsibilities; personnel who have academic responsibilities are referred to as members of their institution's ''faculty.'' In BrE, the word ''staff'' refers to both academic and non-academic school personnel.  As mentioned previously, the term ''faculty'' in BrE refers more to a collection of related academic departments.

====Government and politics====
In Britain, political candidates ''stand for election'', while in the US, they ''run for office''. There is virtually no crossover between BrE and AmE in the use of these terms.  Also, the document which contains a party's positions/principles is referred to as a ''party platform'' in AmE, whereas it is in BrE commonly known as a ''party manifesto''.  The term ''general election'' is used slightly differently in British and American English.  In BrE, it refers exclusively to a nationwide parliamentary election and is differentiated from local elections (mayoral and council), EU Parliamentary Elections and [[by-election]]s; whereas in AmE, it refers to an election for any government position in the US, in AmE the term is differentiated from the term ''primary'' (an election that determines a party's candidate for the position in question).

In AmE, the term ''swing state'', ''swing county'', ''swing district'' is used to denote a jurisdiction/constituency where results are expected to be close but crucial to the overall outcome of the general election.  In BrE, the term ''marginal constituency'' is more often used for the same and ''swing'' is more commonly used to refer to how much one party has gained (or lost) an advantage over another compared to the previous election.

In Britain, the term ''government'' only refers to what is commonly known in America as the executive branch of government.

====Business/Finance====
In financial statements, what is referred to in AmE as ''revenue'' or ''sales'' is known in BrE as ''turnover.''

A bankrupt firm ''[[administration (law)|goes into administration]]'' in BrE; in AmE it ''goes bankrupt'', or ''[[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|files for Chapter 7]]'' (liquidation) or ''[[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]]'' (reorganization).  An insolvent individual or partnership ''goes bankrupt'' in both jurisdictions.

If a finance company takes possession of a mortgaged property from a debtor, it is called ''[[foreclosure]]'' in AmE and ''[[repossession]]'' in BrE. In some, limited scenarios, ''[[repossession]]'' may be used in AmE, but it is much less common compared to ''[[foreclosure]]''.  One common exception in AmE is for automobiles, which are always said to be ''repossessed''.  Indeed, an agent who collects these cars for the bank is colloquially known in AmE as a ''Repoman''.

====Employment/Recruitment====
In BrE, the term ''curriculum vitae'' (commonly abbreviated to ''CV'') is used to describe the document prepared by applicants containing their credentials required for a job.  In AmE, the term ''résumé'' is more commonly used, with ''CV'' primarily used in academic or research contexts, and is usually more comprehensive than the ''résumé''.

====Transport/Transportation====
Americans refer to ''transportation'' and British people to ''transport''.&lt;ref&gt;Gabay, J. Jonathan (2007) ''Gabay's copywriters' compendium: the definitive professional writer's guide'' Elsevier, Oxford, England, [https://books.google.com/books?id=emVzMXpBUoIC&amp;pg=PT144 page 144], ISBN 978-0-7506-8320-3&lt;/ref&gt; (''Transportation'' in Britain has traditionally meant the punishment of criminals by [[Penal transportation|deporting them]] to an overseas penal colony.) In AmE, the word ''transport'' is mainly used only as a verb, seldom as a noun or adjective except in reference to certain specialized objects, such as a ''tape transport'' or a ''military transport'' (e.g., a troop transport, a kind of vehicle, not an act of transporting).

=====Road transport=====
Differences in terminology are especially obvious in the context of [[road]]s. The British term ''[[dual carriageway]]'', in American parlance, would be ''[[divided highway]]''. The ''central reservation'' on a ''motorway'' or ''dual carriageway'' in the UK would be the ''median'' or ''center divide'' on a ''freeway'', ''expressway'', ''highway'' or ''parkway'' in the US. The one-way lanes that make it possible to enter and leave such roads at an intermediate point without disrupting the flow of traffic are known as ''slip roads'' in the UK but US civil engineers call them ''ramps'' and both further distinguish between ''on-ramps'' or ''entry-slips'' (for entering) and ''off-ramps'' or ''exit-slips'' (for leaving). When American engineers speak of ''slip roads'', they are referring to a street that runs alongside the main road (separated by a berm) to allow off-the-highway access to the premises that are there, sometimes also known as a [[frontage road]]—in both the US and UK this is also known as a ''service road''.

In the UK, the term ''outside lane'' refers to the higher-speed ''overtaking lane'' (''passing lane'' in the US) closest to the centre of the road, while ''inside lane'' refers to the lane closer to the edge of the road. In the US ''outside lane'' is used only in the context of a turn, in which case it depends in which direction the road is turning (i.e., if the road bends right the left lane is the &quot;outside lane&quot; but if the road bends left it is the right lane). Both also refer to ''slow'' and ''fast'' lanes (even though all actual traffic speeds may be at or around the legal speed limit).

In the UK ''drink driving'' is against the law, while in the US, where the action is also outlawed, the term is ''drunk driving''. The legal term in the US is ''driving while intoxicated'' (DWI) or ''driving under the influence (of alcohol)'' (DUI). The equivalent legal phrase in the UK is ''drunk in charge of a motor vehicle'' (DIC) or more commonly ''driving with excess alcohol''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/TravelAndTransport/Highwaycode/DG_069870|title=Highway Code: Directgov—Travel and transport|publisher=[[Directgov]]|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, a hired car is the US equivalent of a rental car. The term &quot;hired car&quot; can be especially misleading for those in the US, where the term &quot;hire&quot; is generally only applied to people and the term &quot;rent&quot; is applied to goods. To an American, a &quot;hired car&quot; would therefore imply a driver is being hired with the car, such as a taxi, limousine, Uber driver, etc.

In the UK, a saloon is a vehicle that is equivalent to the American sedan. This is particularly confusing to Americans, because in the US the term saloon is used in only one context: describing an old bar (UK pub) in the American West.  ''Coupé'' is used by both to refer to a two-door car, but is usually pronounced with two syllables in the UK (coo-pay) and one syllable in the US (coop).

In the UK, a silencer is the equivalent to the US muffler. In the US, the word silencer has only one meaning: an attachment on the barrel of a gun designed to stop the distinctive crack of a gunshot.

=====Rail transport=====

{{See also|Glossary of rail transport terms}}

There are also differences in terminology in the context of [[rail transport]]. The best known is ''railway'' in Britain and ''railroad'' in America, but there are several others. A ''railway station'' in the UK is a ''railroad station'' or ''train station'' in the US; trains have ''drivers'' (often called ''engine drivers'') in Britain, while in America trains are driven by ''engineers''; trains have ''guards'' in the UK and  ''conductors'' in the US; a place where two tracks meet is called a set of  ''points'' in the UK and a ''switch'' in the US; and a place where a road crosses a railway line at ground level is called a ''level crossing'' in Britain and a ''grade crossing'' in America.  In Britain, the term ''sleeper'' is used for the devices that bear the weight of the rails and are known as ''ties'' or ''crossties'' in the United States.  The British term ''[[Railway platform|platform]]'' in the sense &quot;The train is at Platform 1&quot; would be known in the US by the term ''track'', and used in the phrase &quot;The train is on Track 1&quot;. Also, the British term ''Brake Van'' or ''Guard's Van'', is a ''Caboose'' in the US. Finally the American English phrase &quot;All aboard!&quot; when getting on a train is rarely used in Britain; the nearest British equivalent is &quot;Take your seats!&quot;, and when the train reaches its final stop, in Britain the phrase used by announcers is &quot;All change!&quot; while in America it is &quot;All out!&quot;

====Television====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
Traditionally, a ''show'' on British [[television]] would have referred to a light-entertainment program (BrE ''programme'') with one or more performers and a participative audience, whereas in American television, the term is used for any type of program. British English traditionally referred to other types of program by their type, such as drama, serial etc., but the term ''show'' has now taken on the American meaning. In American television the episodes of a program first broadcast in a particular year constitute a ''season'', while the entire run of the program—which may span several seasons—is called a ''series''. In British television, on the other hand, the word ''series'' may apply to the episodes of a program in one particular year, for example, &quot;The 1998 series of ''[[Grange Hill]]''&quot;, as well as to the entire run. However, the entire run may occasionally be referred to as a &quot;show&quot;.
The term ''telecast'', meaning television broadcast, is not used in British English. A television program would be ''broadcast'', ''aired'' or ''shown'' in Britain.

====Telecommunications====
{{main article|Trunk versus toll telephony}}
A [[long-distance calling|long-distance call]] is a &quot;trunk call&quot; in British English, but is a &quot;toll call&quot; in American English. The distinction is a result of historical differences in the way local service was billed; the [[Bell System]] traditionally flat-rated local calls in all but a few markets, subsidising local service by charging higher rates, or tolls, for intercity calls, allowing local calls to appear to be free. [[BT Group|British Telecom]] (and the British Post Office before it) charged for all calls, local and long distance, so labelling one class of call as &quot;toll&quot; would have been meaningless.

Similarly, a [[toll-free number]] in America is a [[freephone]] number in Great Britain. The term &quot;freefone&quot; is a BT trademark.

====Levels of buildings====
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}
There are also variations in [[Storey|floor numbering]] between the US and UK. In most countries, including the UK, the &quot;first floor&quot; is one above the entrance level, while the entrance level is the &quot;ground floor&quot;. In the US the ground floor is considered the first floor. In a British lift one would press the &quot;G&quot; or &quot;0&quot; button to return to the ground floor, whereas in an American elevator, one would push the &quot;1&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, or &quot;L&quot; (for Lobby) button to return to the ground floor. The &quot;L&quot; button (or sometimes &quot;-1&quot;) in a British lift would take you to the lower ground floor, which implies that the building is built on a slope and thus there are two ground floors - there would similarly be a &quot;U&quot; button (or &quot;0&quot;) for upper ground floor.

American (AmE) ''apartment buildings'' / (BrE) ''blocks of flats'' are frequently exceptions to this rule. The ground floor often contains the lobby and parking area for the tenants, while the numbered floors begin one level above and contain only the flats (AmE ''apartments'') themselves.

===Units and measurement===

====Numbers====
{{See also|Names of numbers in English}}

When saying or writing out numbers, the British insert an ''and'' before the tens and units, as in ''one hundred and sixty-two'' or ''two thousand and three''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/counting-names-1000.html Maths is fun website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/skillswise/factsheet/ma02symb-l1-f-writing-big-numbers BBC educational website]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States it is considered correct to drop the ''and'', as in ''one hundred sixty-two'' or ''two thousand three''. However, the ''and'' is also retained even in AmE speech, for emphasis or as another acceptable variant.

Some American and Canadian schools teach students to pronounce decimally written fractions (for example, ''.5'') as though they were longhand fractions (''five tenths''), such as ''thirteen and seven tenths'' for 13.7. This formality is often dropped in common speech and is steadily disappearing in instruction in mathematics and science as well as in international American schools. In the UK, and among most Americans, 13.7 would be read ''thirteen point seven''.

In counting, it is common in both varieties of English to count in hundreds up to 1,900—so ''1,200'' may be ''twelve hundred''. However, Americans use this pattern for much higher numbers than is the norm in British English, referring to twenty-four hundred where British English would most often use two thousand four hundred. Even below 2,000, Americans are more likely than the British are to read numbers like 1,234 as ''twelve hundred thirty-four'' instead of ''one thousand two hundred (and) thirty-four''.

In the case of years, however, ''twelve thirty-four'' would be the norm on both sides of the Atlantic for the year 1234. The [[2000s (decade)|years 2000 to 2009]] are most often read as [[2000s (decade)#Names for the decade|''two thousand'', ''two thousand (and) one'' and the like]] by both British and American speakers. For years after 2009, ''twenty eleven'', ''twenty fourteen'', etc. are more common, even in years earlier than 2009 BC/BCE. Likewise, the years after 1009 (until 1099) are also read in the same manner (e.g. 1015 is either ''ten fifteen'' or, rarely, ''one thousand fifteen''). Some Britons read years within the 1000s to 9000s BC/BCE in the American manner, that is, 1234 BC is read as ''twelve (hundred and) thirty-four'' BC, while 2400 BC can be read as either ''two thousand four hundred'' or ''twenty four hundred'' BC.

There is also a historical difference between [[Long and short scales|billions]], trillions, and so forth. Americans use ''billion'' to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000), whereas in the UK, until the latter part of the 20th century, it was used to mean one million million (1,000,000,000,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/page/howmanybillion|title=Oxford Dictionaries - How Many is a Billion?|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, told the House of Commons that UK government statistics would now use the short scale, followed by the Chancellor, Denis Healey, in 1975, that the treasury would now adopt the US billion version.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}} One thousand million was sometimes described as a ''[[milliard]]'', the definition adopted by most other European languages.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}} However, the &quot;American&quot; version has since been adopted for all published writing, and the word ''milliard'' is obsolete in English, as are ''[[Billiard (number)|billiard]]'' (but not ''[[billiards]]'', the game), ''[[trilliard]]'', and so on.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}} All major British publications and broadcasters, including BBC, which long used ''thousand million'' to avoid ambiguity, now use ''billion'' to mean thousand million.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2011}}

Many people have no direct experience of manipulating numbers this large, and many non-American readers may interpret ''billion'' as 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (even if they are young enough to have been taught otherwise at school); moreover, usage of the &quot;long&quot; billion is standard in some non-English speaking countries. For these reasons, defining the word may be advisable when writing for the public. See [[long and short scales]] for a more detailed discussion of the evolution of these terms in English and other languages.

When [[Names for the number 0 in English|referring to the numeral 0]], British people would normally use ''nought'', ''oh'', or ''zero'', although ''nil'' is common in sports scores. Americans use the term ''zero'' most frequently; ''oh'' is also often used (though never when the quantity in question is nothing), and occasionally slang terms such as ''zilch'' or ''zip'' are used. Phrases such as ''the team won two–zip'' or ''the team leads the series two–nothing'' are heard when reporting sports scores. In the case of [[association football]]—known as &quot;football&quot; in Britain and &quot;soccer&quot; in America—Americans will sometimes use &quot;nil&quot; as in Britain, although this usage is mostly confined to soccer journalists and hardcore fans and is not universal among either group. The digit 0, for example, when a phone or account number is being read aloud, is nearly always pronounced ''oh'' in both language varieties for the sake of convenience. In the internet age the use of the term ''oh'' can cause certain inconveniences when one is referencing an email address, causing confusion as to whether the character in question is a zero or the letter &quot;O&quot;.

When reading numbers in a sequence, such as a telephone or serial number, British people will usually use the terms ''double'' followed by the repeated number. Hence [[James Bond|007]] is ''double oh seven''. Exceptions are the emergency telephone number [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]], which is always ''nine nine nine'' and the apocalyptic &quot;[[Number of the Beast]]&quot;, which is always ''six six six''. In the US, [[9-1-1|911]] (the US emergency telephone number) is usually read ''nine one one'', while 9/11 (in reference to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]]) is usually read ''nine eleven''.

====Monetary amounts====
* Monetary amounts in the range of one to two major currency units are often spoken differently. In AmE one may say ''a dollar fifty'' or ''a pound eighty'', whereas in BrE these amounts would be expressed ''one dollar fifty'' and ''one pound eighty''. For amounts over a dollar an American will generally either drop denominations or give both dollars and cents, as in ''two-twenty'' or ''two dollars and twenty cents'' for $2.20. An American would not say ''two dollars twenty''. On the other hand, in BrE, ''two-twenty'' or ''two pounds twenty'' would be most common.
* It is more common to hear a British-English speaker say ''one thousand two hundred dollars'' than ''a thousand and two hundred dollars'', although the latter construct is common in AmE.  In British English, the &quot;'''''and'''''&quot; comes after the hundreds (''one thousand, two hundred '''''and''''' thirty dollars''). The term ''twelve hundred dollars'', popular in AmE, is frequently used in BrE but only for exact multiples of 100 up to 1900. Speakers of BrE very rarely hear amounts over 1900 expressed in hundreds, for example twenty-three hundred.
* In BrE, particularly in television or radio advertisements, integers can be pronounced individually in the expression of amounts. For example, ''on sale for £399'' might be expressed ''on sale for three nine nine'', though the full ''Three hundred '''''and''''' ninety-nine pounds'' is at least as common. An American advertiser would almost always say ''on sale for three ninety-nine'', with context distinguishing $399 from $3.99.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In British English the latter pronunciation implies a value in pounds and pence, so ''three ninety-nine'' would be understood as £3.99.
* The BrE slang term ''quid'' is roughly equivalent to the AmE ''buck'' and is often used informally for whole (''round'') pound/dollar amounts, as in ''fifty-three quid'' for £53 and ''forty-seven bucks'' for $47. ''A hundred and fifty grand'' in either dialect could refer to £150,000 or $150,000 depending on context. ''Quid'' was formerly also used in Ireland for the punt and today is used for the euro. &quot;Quid&quot; does not (generally) have a plural form but &quot;buck&quot; does (aside from the expression [[Wiktionary:quids in|quids in]]—meaning having made or won a lot of money).
* A user of AmE may hand-write the mixed monetary amount $3.24 as $3&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; or $3&lt;sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;24&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (often seen for extra clarity on a check); BrE users will write this as £3.24 or sometimes £3‒24. There may or may not be a space after the currency symbol, or the currency symbols may be omitted depending on context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsa.org.uk/mediacentre/press/cheque_sept.htm BSA changes to cheque writing] see end of numbered item 9&lt;/ref&gt;
*In order to make explicit the amount in words on a check (BrE cheque), Americans write ''three and {{Frac|24|100}}'' (using this [[Solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] construction or with a horizontal division line): they do not need to write the word ''dollars'' as it is usually already printed on the check. On a cheque UK residents would write ''three pounds and 24 pence'', ''three pounds ‒ 24'' or ''three pounds ‒ 24p'' since the currency unit is not preprinted. To make unauthorized amendment difficult, it is useful to have an expression terminator even when a whole number of dollars/pounds is in use: thus, Americans would write ''three and {{Frac|00|100}}'' or ''three and {{Frac|no|100}}'' on a three-dollar check (so that it cannot easily be changed to, for example, ''three million''), and UK residents would write ''three pounds only''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsa.org.uk/mediacentre/press/cheque_sept.htm] see end of numbered item 9&lt;/ref&gt;
* The term ''[[pound sign]]'' in BrE always refers to the currency symbol £, whereas in AmE ''pound sign'' means the [[number sign]], which the British call the ''hash'' symbol, #. (From the 1960s to the 1990s the British telephone company, [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|the GPO]] and its successors [[Post Office Telecommunications]] and [[BT Group|British Telecom]] referred to this as ''gate'' on telephone keypads.)  In the 21st century, the # symbol has become known as a ''hashtag'' when used on social media, such as [[Twitter]].
*In spoken BrE the word ''pound'' is sometimes colloquially used for the plural as well. For example ''three pound forty'' and ''twenty pound a week'' are both heard in British English. Some other currencies do not change in the plural; yen and rand being examples. This is in addition to normal adjectival use, as in ''a twenty-pound-a-week pay-rise''. The [[Linguistic issues concerning the euro#English|euro]] most often takes a regular plural -s in practice despite the EU dictum that it should remain invariable in formal contexts; the invariable usage is more common in Ireland, where it is the official currency.
* In BrE the use of ''p'' instead of ''[[pence]]'' is common in spoken usage. Each of the following has equal legitimacy: ''3 pounds 12 p''; ''3 pounds and 12 p''; ''3 pounds 12 pence''; ''3 pounds and 12 pence''; as well as just ''8 p'' or ''8 pence''. In everyday usage the amount is simply read as figures (£3.50 = three pounds fifty)as in AmE.
* AmE uses words such as ''[[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]]'', ''[[Dime (United States coin)|dime]]'', and ''[[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]]'' for small coins. In BrE the usual usage is ''a 10-pence piece'' or ''a 10p piece'' or simply ''a 10p'', for any coin below £1, but ''pound coin'' and ''two-pound coin''. BrE did have [[Coins of the pound sterling#Slang and everyday usage|specific words for a number of coins]] before [[Decimal Day|decimalisation]]. Formal coin names such as ''half crown'' (2/6) and ''florin'' (2/-), as well as slang or familiar names such as ''bob'' (1/-) and ''tanner'' (6d) for pre-decimalization coins are still familiar to older BrE speakers but they are not used for modern coins. In older terms like ''two-bob bit'' (2/-) and ''thrupenny bit'' (3d), the word ''bit'' had common usage before decimalisation similar to that of ''piece'' today.

====Dates====
Dates are usually written differently in the short (numerical) form. Christmas Day 2000, for example, is 25/12/00 or 25.12.00 in the UK and 12/25/00 in the US, although the formats 25/12/2000, 25.12.2000, and 12/25/2000 now have more currency than they had before the [[Year 2000 problem]]. Occasionally other formats are encountered, such as the [[ISO 8601]] 2000-12-25, popular among programmers, scientists and others seeking to avoid ambiguity, and to make [[alphanumeric]]al order coincide with [[chronological]] order. The difference in short-form date order can lead to misunderstanding. For example 06/04/05 could mean either June 4, 2005 (if read as US format), 6 April 2005 (if seen as in UK format) or even 5 April 2006 if taken to be an older ISO 8601-style format where 2-digit years were allowed.

When the output of a computer printer has a date in the header or footer this can cause problems since the date style depends on the software, not the country where the printer is located.

When using the name of the month rather than the number to write a date in the UK, the recent standard style is for the day to precede the month, e. g., 21 April. Month preceding date is almost invariably the style in the US, and was common in the UK until the late twentieth century. British usage often changes the day from an integer to an ordinal, i.e., 21st instead of 21. In speech, &quot;of&quot; and &quot;the&quot; are used in the UK, as in &quot;the 21st of April&quot;. In written language, the words &quot;the&quot; and &quot;of&quot; may be and are usually dropped, i.e., 21 April. The US would say this as &quot;April 21st&quot;, and this form is still common in the UK. One of the few exceptions in American English is saying &quot;the Fourth of July&quot; as a shorthand for the United States [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]. In the US military the British forms are used, but the day is read cardinally, while among some speakers of [[New England English|New England]] and [[Southern American English]] varieties and who come from those regions but live elsewhere, those forms are common, even in formal contexts.

Phrases such as the following are common in Britain but are generally unknown in the US: &quot;A week today&quot;, &quot;a week tomorrow&quot;, &quot;a week Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Tuesday week&quot;; these all refer to a day more than a week in the future. &quot;A fortnight Friday&quot; and &quot;Friday fortnight&quot; refer to a day two weeks after the coming Friday). &quot;A week on Tuesday&quot; and &quot;a fortnight on Friday&quot; could refer either to a day in the past (&quot;it's a week on Tuesday, you need to get another one&quot;) or in the future (&quot;see you a week on Tuesday&quot;), depending on context. In the US the standard construction is &quot;a week from today&quot;, &quot;a week from tomorrow&quot;, etc. BrE speakers may also say &quot;Thursday last&quot; or &quot;Thursday gone&quot; where AmE would prefer &quot;last Thursday&quot;. &quot;I'll see you (on) Thursday coming&quot; or &quot;let's meet this coming Thursday&quot; in BrE refer to a meeting later this week, while &quot;not until Thursday next&quot; would refer to next week.

====Time====
The [[24-hour clock]] (''18:00'', ''18.00'' or ''1800'') is considered normal in the UK and Europe in many applications including air, rail and bus timetables; it is largely unused in the US outside military, police, aviation and medical applications. British English tends to use the full stop or period (.) when telling time, compared to American English which uses Colons (:) (i.e., 11:15 PM or 23:15 for AmE and 11.15 pm or 23.15 for BrE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trask|first=Larry|title=The Colon|url=http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/department/docs/punctuation/node16.html|work=Guide to Punctuation|publisher=University of Sussex|accessdate=21 August 2013|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually in the military (and sometimes in the police, aviation and medical) applications on both sides of the Atlantic ''0800'' and ''1800'' are read as ''(oh/zero) eight hundred'' and ''eighteen hundred'' hours respectively.

Fifteen minutes after the hour is called ''quarter past'' in British usage and ''a quarter after'' or, less commonly, ''a quarter past'' in American usage. Fifteen minutes before the hour is usually called ''quarter to'' in British usage and ''a quarter of'', ''a quarter to'' or ''a quarter 'til'' in American usage; the form ''a quarter to'' is associated with parts of the [[Northern United States]], while ''a quarter 'til'' is found chiefly in the [[Appalachia]]n region.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Thirty minutes after the hour is commonly called ''half past'' in both BrE and AmE; ''half after'' used to be more common in the US. In informal British speech, the preposition is sometimes omitted, so that 5:30 may be referred to as ''half five''. The AmE formations ''top of the hour'' and ''bottom of the hour'' are not used in BrE. Forms such as ''eleven forty'' are common in both dialects. To be simple and direct in telling time, no terms relating to fifteen or thirty minutes before/after the hour are used; rather the time is told exactly as for example ''nine fifteen'', ''ten forty-five''.

====Mass====

In British usage, human body mass is colloquially expressed in [[stone (Imperial mass)|stones]] (equal to 14 [[Pounds (mass)|pounds]]). People normally describe themselves as weighing, for example, &quot;11 stone 4&quot; (11 stones and 4 pounds) and not &quot;158 pounds&quot; (the conventional way of expressing the same weight in the United States). Stones are never used in the United States, and most Americans are unfamiliar with the term. [[Kilogram]]mes (note the difference from the U.S. spelling, ''kilograms'') are the official measurement in the United Kingdom, although very few people know their weight in kilogrammes. This is rarely noticed by the British (one such occasion might be a weight measurement at a hospital).

When used as the unit of measurement the plural form of ''stone'' is correctly ''stone'' (as in &quot;11 stone&quot;). When describing the units, the correct plural is ''stones'' (as in &quot;Please enter your weight in stones and pounds&quot;).

===Mathematics===
The shorthand word for the subject itself is ''Maths'' for BrE and ''Math'' for AmE.

In geometry, what is referred to as a ''trapezoid'' (a quadrilateral with exactly 1 pair of parallel sides) in US textbooks is a ''trapezium'' in its UK counterparts.

===Holiday greetings===
{{Main article|Holiday greetings}}
It is increasingly common for Americans to say &quot;Happy holidays&quot;, referring to all, or at least multiple, winter holidays (Christmas, [[Hanukkah]], [[Winter solstice]], [[Kwanzaa]], etc.) especially when the subject's religious observances are not known; the phrase is rarely heard in the U.K. In Britain, the phrases &quot;holiday season&quot; and &quot;holiday period&quot; refer to the period in the summer when most people take time off from work, and travel; AmE does not use ''holiday'' in this sense, instead using ''[[vacation]]'' for recreational excursions.

===Idiosyncratic differences===

====Figures of speech====
Both BrE and AmE use the expression &quot;I couldn't care less&quot; to mean the speaker does not care at all. Many Americans use &quot;I could care less&quot; to mean the same thing. This variant is frequently derided as sloppy, as the literal meaning of the words is that the speaker ''does'' care to some extent.

In both areas, saying, &quot;I don't mind&quot; often means, &quot;I'm not annoyed&quot; (for example, by someone's smoking), while &quot;I don't care&quot; often means, &quot;The matter is trivial or boring&quot;. However, in answering a question such as &quot;Tea or coffee?&quot;, if either alternative is equally acceptable an American may answer, &quot;I don't care&quot;, while a British person may answer, &quot;I don't mind&quot;. Either sounds odd to the other.

====Equivalent idioms====

A number of English idioms that have essentially the same meaning show lexical differences between the British and the American version; for instance:

===Spelling===
{{Main article|American and British English spelling differences}}
Before the early 18th century [[English spelling]] was not standardized. Different standards became noticeable after the publishing of influential [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. For the most part current BrE spellings follow those of [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language|Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755), while AmE spellings follow those of [[Noah Webster]]'s ''[[An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1828). In Britain, the influences of those who preferred the French spellings of certain words proved decisive. In many cases AmE spelling deviated from mainstream British spelling; on the other hand it has also often retained older forms. Many of the now characteristic AmE spellings were popularized, although often not created, by Noah Webster. Webster chose already-existing alternative spellings &quot;on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John. &quot;The Effects of the Revolution on Language&quot;, in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. p.599&lt;/ref&gt; Webster did attempt to introduce some [[English-language spelling reform|reformed spellings]], as did the [[Simplified Spelling Board]] in the early 20th century, but most were not adopted. Later spelling changes in the UK had little effect on present-day US spelling, and vice versa.

===Punctuation===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[List of British words not widely used in the United States]] --&gt;

====Full stops and periods in abbreviations====
There have been some trends of transatlantic difference in use of periods in some abbreviations. These are discussed at ''[[Abbreviation#Periods (full stops) and spaces|Abbreviation § Periods (full stops) and spaces]]''. Unit symbols such as kg and Hz are never punctuated.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIBrochure8th|page = 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restrictive and non-restrictive modifiers====
In American English, restrictive and non-restrictive modifying phrases require different words and sentence structures. In particular, a non-restrictive modifying phrase must be set off by commas, and it generally uses &quot;which&quot; as its pronoun. A restrictive modifying phrase, by contrast, is not set off by commas, and uses the pronoun &quot;that.&quot; An example of the first in American English is: &quot;The dog, which bit the man, was brown.&quot; In that sentence the phrase &quot;which bit the man&quot; is non-restrictive: it is merely providing background information about a dog whose identity is otherwise not in question. The contrasting sentence in American English would be: &quot;The dog that bit the man was brown.&quot; In this sentence, the phrase &quot;that bit the man&quot; is restrictive: it tells the reader that, of several dogs that might have bitten the man, the actual biter was brown. Interchanging the two structures is grammatically incorrect in American English because they have different meanings.

British English, by contrast, generally does not require its writers to construct sentences in a manner that distinguishes between the restrictive and non-restrictive forms of modifiers. Thus, a writer of British English might write: &quot;The dog which bit the man was brown.&quot; In this sentence, it is ambiguous whether the phrase &quot;which bit the man&quot; is serving to identify a particular dog among several candidates or just to provide background information about a dog whose identity is otherwise not in doubt. Readers must try to infer the distinction from context or from their own knowledge.

[[H. W. Fowler]], in ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' of 1926, recommends &quot;that&quot;, without a preceding comma, for restrictive (&quot;defining&quot;) use and &quot;which&quot;, with a comma, for descriptive (&quot;non-defining&quot;) use. However, he notes that it was not (then) commonly British English usage, and that British and American usages differed, without explicitly identifying this usage as American. He also notes several problems with this usage &quot;The most important of these is its [''that'''s] insistence on being the first word of its clause ; &lt;!-- The preceding space is, as was at one time common in such printed material, part of the quotation and should not be removed. --&gt; it cannot, like ''whom'' &amp; ''which'', endure that a preposition governing it should, by coming before it, part it from the antecedent or the main sentence ; such a preposition has to go, instead, at the end of the clause ; that is quite in harmony with the closer connexion between a defining, (or ''that''-) clause &amp; the antecedent than between a non-defining (or ''which''-) clause &amp; the antecedent ; but it forces the writer to choose between ending his sentence or clause with a preposition &amp; and giving up ''that'' for ''which''.&quot; However, Fowler also goes on to reprise his assertion that prepositional endings are acceptable: &quot;to shrink with horror from ending with a preposition is no more than a foolish superstition&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fowlers Modern English Usage&quot;&gt;Fowler, Henry; Winchester, Simon (introduction) (2003 reprint). ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage (Oxford Language Classics Series)''. Oxford Press. ISBN 0-19-860506-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Quoting====
Americans begin their quotations with double [[quotation mark]]s (&quot;) and use single quotation marks (') for quotations within quotations (nested quotations). BrE usage varies, with some authoritative sources such as ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' recommending the same usage as in the US,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;American and British English&quot;. ''The Economist Style Guide'' (Fourth ed.). London: Hamish Hamilton Ltd. 1996. p. 85. ISBN 0241135567. Tim Austin, Richard Dixon (2003) ''The Times Style and Usage Guide''. London: HarperCollins. ISBN 0007145055&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other authoritative sources, such as ''[[The King's English]]'', recommend single quotation marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/116/406.html |title=Quotation Marks. Fowler, H. W. 1908. The King's English |publisher=Bartleby.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In journals and newspapers, quotation mark double/single use depends on the individual publication's [[Style guide|house style]].

American guides almost always recommend placing [[comma]]s and periods inside adjacent quotation marks. Specific exceptions are made for cases in which the addition of a period or comma could create confusion, such as the quotation of web addresses or certain types of data strings. In both styles, question marks and exclamation marks are placed inside the quotation marks if they belong to the quotation and outside otherwise. With narration of direct speech, both styles retain punctuation inside the quotation marks, with a full stop changing into a comma if followed by explanatory text, also known as a dialogue tag. Americans tend to apply quotations when signifying doubt of veracity (sarcastically or seriously), to imply another meaning to a word or to imply a cynical take on a paraphrased quotation, without punctuation at all.
* Carefree means &quot;free from care or anxiety.&quot; (American style)
* Carefree means 'free from care or anxiety'. (British style, optional use of single quotes)
* &quot;Hello, John,&quot; I said. (both styles){{dubious|date=December 2015}}
* Did you say, &quot;I'm shot&quot;? No, I said, &quot;Why not?&quot; (Both styles)
* My &quot;friend&quot; just told the whole school my secret. (American style, but also common in British English)
The American style is used by most American newspapers, publishing houses and style guides in the United States and Canada (including the Modern Language Association's ''[[MLA Style Manual]]'', the American Psychological Association's ''[[APA style|APA Publication Manual]]'', the University of Chicago's ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', the American Institute of Physics's ''AIP Style Manual'', the American Medical Association's ''AMA Manual of Style'', the American Political Science Association's ''APSA Style Manual'', the [[Associated Press]]' ''The AP Guide to Punctuation'' and the [[Public Works and Government Services Canada|Canadian Public Works']] ''The Canadian Style'').&lt;ref&gt;Other style guides and reference volumes include: ''U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual'' (2008, p. 217), US Department of Education's ''IES Style Guide'' (2005, p. 43), ''The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing'' (1997, p. 148), ''International Committee of Medical Journal Editors'', ''International Reading Association Style Guide'', ''American Dialect Society'', Association of Legal Writing Directors' ''ALWD Citation Manual'', ''The McGraw-Hill Desk Reference'' by K.

''[[Hart's Rules]]'' and the ''[[Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors]]'' call the British style &quot;new&quot; quoting. It is also similar to the use of quotation marks in many other languages (including Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, Catalan, Dutch and German). A few US professional societies whose professions frequently employ various non-word characters, such as chemistry and computer programming, use the British form in their style guides (see ''ACS Style Guide''). According to the ''[[Jargon File]]'', American [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]s switched to what they later discovered to be the British quotation system because placing a period inside a quotation mark can change the meaning of data strings that are meant to be typed character-for-character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/writing-style.html |title=The Jargon File, Chapter 5. Hacker Writing Style |publisher=www.catb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}} (It may be noted that the current American system places periods and commas outside the quotation marks in these cases anyway.)

====Parentheses/brackets====
In British English, &quot;( )&quot; marks are often referred to as brackets, whereas &quot;[ ]&quot; are called square brackets and &quot;{ }&quot; are called curly brackets. In formal British English and in American English &quot;( )&quot; marks are parentheses (singular: parenthesis), &quot;[ ]&quot; are called brackets, and &quot;{ }&quot; can be called either curly brackets or curly braces.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Crystal|first=David|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2003|edition=second|ISBN=0-521-82348-X|page=278}} &quot;It also gives ... clues about the prosody ... through such features as question marks, exclamation marks and parentheses&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; In both countries, standard usage is to place punctuation outside the parenthesis, unless the entire sentence is contained within them:
* &quot;I am going to the store (if it is still open).&quot;
* (This page is intentionally blank.)
In the case of a parenthetical expression which is itself a complete sentence, the final punctuation may be placed inside the parenthesis, particularly if not a period:
* &quot;I am going to the store (Is it still open?)&quot;
* &quot;I am going to the store (I hope it's still open!)&quot;

===Titles and headlines===
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
Use of [[capitalization]] varies.

Sometimes the words in titles of publications and newspaper headlines as well as chapter and section headings are capitalized in the same manner as in normal sentences ([[sentence case]]). That is, only the first letter of the first word is capitalised, along with [[proper noun]]s, etc.

However, publishers sometimes require additional words in titles and headlines to have the initial capital, for added [[emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], as it is often perceived as appearing more professional. In AmE this is common in titles but less so in newspaper headlines. The exact rules differ between publishers and are often ambiguous; a typical approach is to capitalise all words other than short [[Article (grammar)|articles]], [[preposition]]s, and [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]]. This should probably be regarded as a common stylistic difference rather than a linguistic difference, as neither form would be considered incorrect or unusual in either the UK or the US. Many British [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] (such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', ''[[The Daily Sport]]'') use fully capitalised headlines for impact as opposed to readability (for example, BERLIN WALL FALLS or BIRD FLU PANIC). On the other hand the [[broadsheet]]s (such as ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and ''[[The Independent]]'') usually follow the sentence style of having only the first letter of the first word capitalised.

American newspapers commonly use a comma as a shorthand for &quot;and&quot; in headlines. For example, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' had the headline &quot;A TRUE CONSERVATIVE: For McCain, Bush Has Both Praise, Advice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/feb/13/headlinecommaswhoneedsthem |title=Headline Commas, Who Needs Them? |last=Greenslade|first=Roy|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-02-13|accessdate=2011-06-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accrington''' is a town in the [[Hyndburn]] borough of [[Lancashire]], England. It lies about {{convert|4|mi|0}} east of [[Blackburn]], {{convert|6|mi|0}} west of [[Burnley]], {{convert|13|mi|0}} east of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], {{convert|20|mi|0}} north of [[Manchester city centre]] and is situated on the mostly [[culvert]]ed [[River Hyndburn]]. Commonly abbreviated by locals to &quot;'''Accy'''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://menmedia.co.uk/accringtonobserver/sport/football/accrington_stanley/s/1418758_accys-easter-rising|title=Accy's Easter Rising|publisher=MEN Media - Accrington Observer|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the town has a population of 45,600 according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] and the urban area has a population of over 80,000.

Accrington is a former centre of the cotton and textile machinery industries. The town is famed for manufacturing the hardest and densest building bricks in the world, [[Accrington brick|&quot;The Accrington NORI&quot;]] (iron), which were used in the construction of the [[Empire State Building]] and for the foundations of [[Blackpool Tower]]; famous for [[Accrington Stanley F.C.]] and the [[Haworth Art Gallery]] which holds Europe's largest collection of [[Tiffany glass]].

==History==

===Origin of the name===
The name Accrington appears to be [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] in origin. In the records it variously appears as ''Akarinton'' in 1194; ''Akerunton'', ''Akerinton'' and ''Akerynton'' in 1258; ''Acrinton'' in 1292; ''Ackryngton'' in 1311 and ''Acryngton'' in 1324.&lt;ref name=&quot;Names&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/placenamesoflanc00ekwauoft#page/89/mode/1up|title=Accrington|work=Place Names of Lancashire|author=Ellert Ekwall|page=89|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Victoria&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924088434620|title=Accrington|work=The Victoria history of the county of Lancaster;|author=William Farrer, J Brownbill|page=423|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name may mean ''acorn farmstead'' from Anglo-Saxon ''æcern'' meaning ''acorn'' and ''tun'' meaning ''farmstead'' or ''village''.&lt;ref name=Names /&gt; The southern part of Accrington, the township of New Accrington, was formerly in the Forest of Blackburnshire and the presence of oak trees may be inferred from local place names like Broad Oak and Oak Hill. The products of oak trees were once an important food for swine and a farmstead may have been named for such produce.&lt;ref name=Names /&gt; Anglo-Saxon  ''ᴁcerntun'' might become [[Middle English]] ''Akerenton'', ''Akerinton'' and the like.&lt;ref name=Names /&gt; Also worth considering is that in the Lancashire dialect  ''acorn'' was ''akran''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL7247738M/A_glossary_of_the_Lancashire_dialect|title=A Glossary of the Lancashire Dialect|publisher=Open Library|accessdate=17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no known Old English personal name from which the first element can be derived. But if the [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] names ''Akkrum'', ''Akkeringa'' and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name ''Akkerghem'', are derived from the personal name ''Akker'' there may be a corresponding Old English name from which ''Accrington'' may be derived.&lt;ref name=Names /&gt;

===Early history===
Accrington covers two [[Township (England)|townships]] which were established in 1507 following disafforestation; those of Old Accrington and New Accrington which were merged in 1878 with the incorporation of the borough council.&lt;ref name=BHO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53146|title='Townships: Old and New Accrington'; A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 6|publisher=William Farrer &amp; J. Brownbill|accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been settlements there since the medieval period, likely in the Grange Lane and Black Abbey area,&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Assessment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/environment/documents/historictowns/AccringtonComplete_LowRes.pdf|title=Accrington Historic Town Assessment report|publisher=Lancashire County Council and Egerton Lea Consultancy with the support of English Heritage and Hyndburn Borough Council |accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the King's Highway which passes above the town was at one time used by the kings and queens of England when they used the area for hunting when the [[Royal forest|Forest of Accrington]] was one of the four forests of the [[Hundred (administrative division)|hundred]] of [[Blackburnshire]].

[[Robert de Lacy]] gave the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Accrington to the monks of [[Kirkstall Abbey|Kirkstall]] in the 12th century. The monks built a [[Monastic grange|grange]] there; removing the inhabitants to make room for it. The locals got their revenge by setting fire to the new building, destroying its contents and in the process killing the three lay brothers who occupied it.&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt; An area of the town is named 'Black Abbey', a possible reference to the murders. Regardless of whatever happened, Accrington did not remain under monastic control for long before reverting to the [[de Lacy]]s.

It is thought the monks of Kirkstall may have built a small chapel there during their tenure for the convenience of those in charge residing there and their tenants, but the records are uncertain.&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt; What is known is that there was a chapel in Accrington prior to 1553&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt; where the vicar of Whalley was responsible for the maintenance of divine worship. However it did not have its own minister and it was served, when at all, by the curate of one of the adjacent chapels. In 1717 Accrington was served by the curate of Church, who preached there only once a month.&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt; St. James's Church was built in 1763, replacing the old chapel&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt; however it did not achieve parochial status until as late as 1870.&lt;ref name=Assessment /&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}
&lt;!-- *Historical importance *Economic Significance *Industrial Gorwth *Pre and Post industrial Accrington --&gt;

Until around 1830 visitors considered Accrington to be just a &quot;considerable village&quot;.&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]], however, resulted in large changes and Accrington’s location on the confluence of a number of streams made it attractive to industry and a number of mills were built in the town in the mid-eighteenth century. Further industrialisation then followed in the late eighteenth century and local landowners began building mansions in the area on the outskirts of the settlement where their mills were located while their employees lived in overcrowded unsanitary conditions in the centre.&lt;ref name=Assessment /&gt;

Industrialisation resulted in rapid population growth during the nineteenth century, as people moved from over north-west England to Accrington,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localpopulationstudies.org.uk/PDF/LPS30/LPS30_1983_28-34.pdf|title=Patterns of Migration of Textile Workers into Accrington in the Nineteenth Century|publisher=William Turner|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the population increasing from 3,266 in 1811 to 10,376 in 1851 to 43,211 in 1901&lt;ref name=Assessment /&gt; to its peak in 1911 at 45,029.&lt;ref name=Frith&gt;{{Cite book|author=H Barrett &amp; C Duckworth|title=Accrington Old &amp; New|publisher=Frith Book Company Ltd|year=2004|isbn=1-85937-806-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This fast population growth and slow response from the [[Church of England|established church]] allowed [[nonconformism|non-conformism]] to flourish in the town. By the mid-nineteenth century there were Wesleyan, Primitive Methodist, United Free Methodist, Congregationalist, Baptist, Swedenborgian, Unitarian, Roman Catholic and Catholic Apostolic churches in the town.&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt; The [[Swedenborgian Church|Swedenborgian church]] was so grand that it was considered to be the ‘Cathedral’ of that denomination.&lt;ref name=Frith /&gt;

For many decades the textiles industry, the engineering industry and coal mining were the central activities of the town. [[Cotton mills]] and [[dye]] works provided work for the inhabitants, but often in very difficult conditions. There was regular conflict with employers over wages and working conditions. On 24 April 1826 over 1,000 men and women, many armed, gathered at Whinney Hill in [[Clayton-le-Moors]] to listen to a speaker from where they marched on Sykes’s Mill at Higher Grange Lane, near the site of the modern police station and Magistrate’s Courts, and smashed over 60 looms. These riots spread from Accrington through Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Darwen, Rossendale, Bury and Chorley. In the end after three days of riots 1,139 looms were destroyed, 4 rioters and 2 bystanders shot dead by the authorities in Rossendale and 41 rioters sentenced to death (all of whose sentences were commuted).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/1826-03.htm |title=Cotton Times |publisher=Doug Peacock |accessdate=17 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604221023/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/1826-03.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Turner|first=William|title=Riot! Story of East Lancashire Loom Breakers in 1826|publisher=Lancashire County Books|year=1992 |isbn=978-1-871236-17-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1842 [[1842 General Strike|'plug riots']]  a [[general strike]] spread from town to town due to conditions in the town. In a population of 9,000 people as few as 100 were fully employed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An alarming statement of distress&quot;, the Newcastle Courant, 1 July 1842&lt;/ref&gt; From 15 August 1842 the situation boiled over and bands of men entered the mills which were running and stopped the machinery by knocking out the boiler plugs. This allowed the water and steam to escape shutting down the mill machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Newbigging|first=Thomas|title=History of the Forest of Rossendale|publisher=Rossendale Free Press|year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of strikers walked over the hills from one town to another to persuade people to join the strike in civil disturbances that lasted about a week.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Riot in Accrington&quot;, the Preston Chronicle, 3 September 1842&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Disturbances in the Manufacturing Districts&quot;, the Liverpool Mercury, 19 August 1842&lt;/ref&gt; The strike was associated with the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement but eventually proved unsuccessful in its aims.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;State of Trade&quot;, the Preston Chronicle, 12 November 1842&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1860s the [[Lancashire cotton famine]] badly affected Accrington, although less so than the wider area due to its more diverse economy,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Distress in Lancashire&quot;, The Leeds Mercury, 25 October 1862&lt;/ref&gt; with as many as half of the town's mill employees out of work at one time.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;State of Employment&quot;, The Preston Guardian, 3 December 1864&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions were such that a Local Board of Health was constituted in 1853 and the town itself incorporated in 1878 allowing the enforcement of local laws to improve the town.&lt;ref name=BHO /&gt;&lt;ref name=Assessment /&gt;

===Accrington Pals===
{{further information|Recruitment to the British Army during World War I}}

One well-known association the town has is with the '[[Accrington Pals]]', the nickname given to the smallest home town [[battalion]] of volunteers formed to fight in the [[World War I|First World War]]. The [[Pals battalion]]s were a peculiarity of the 1914-18 war: [[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], believed that it would help recruitment if friends and work-mates from the same town were able to join up and fight together. Strictly speaking, the 'Accrington Pals' battalion is properly known as the '11th [[East Lancashire Regiment]]': the nickname is a little misleading, since of the four 250-strong companies that made up the original battalion only one was composed of men from Accrington. The rest volunteered from other east [[Lancashire]] towns such as [[Burnley]], [[Blackburn]] and [[Chorley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pals.org.uk/pals_e.htm|title=The Accrington Pals|first=Andrew C|last=Jackson|year=2009|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pals' first day of action, 1 July 1916, took place in Serre, near [[Montauban-de-Picardie|Montauban]] in the north of France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ww1battlefields.co.uk/somme/serre.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the 'Big Push' (later known as the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Battle of the Somme]]) that was intended to force the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] into a retreat from the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], a line they had held since late 1914. The German defences in Serre were supposed to have been obliterated by sustained, heavy, British shelling during the preceding week; however, as the battalion advanced it met with fierce resistance. 235 men were killed and a further 350 wounded &amp;mdash; more than half of the battalion &amp;mdash; within half an hour. Similarly desperate losses were suffered elsewhere on the front, [[First day on the Somme|in a disastrous day]] for the British Army (approximately 19,000 British soldiers were killed in a single day).

Later in the year, the East Lancashire Regiment was rebuilt with new volunteers &amp;mdash; in all, 865 Accrington men were killed during World War I. All of these names are recorded on a war memorial, an imposing white stone cenotaph, which stands in Oak Hill Park in the south of the town. The [[cenotaph]] also lists the names of 173 local fatalities from [[World War II]]. The trenches from which the Accrington Pals advanced on 1 July 1916 are still visible in John Copse west of the village of Serre, and there is a memorial there made of Accrington brick.

After the war and until 1986, Accrington Corporation buses were painted in the regimental colours of red and blue with gold lining. The mudguards were painted black as a sign of mourning.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Demography==
The 2001 census gave the population of Accrington town as 45,600. The figure for the urban area was 78,224, increased from 70,442 in 1991. This total includes Accrington, [[Church, Lancashire|Church]], [[Clayton-le-Moors]], [[Great Harwood]] and [[Oswaldtwistle]]. For comparison purposes that is approximately the same size as [[Aylesbury]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Guildford]] or [[Scunthorpe]] urban areas.

The borough of [[Hyndburn]] as a whole has a population of 88,996. This includes Accrington Urban Area and other outlying towns and villages such as; [[Altham, Lancashire|Altham]], [[Baxenden]], part of [[Belthorn]], [[Huncoat]], [[Rishton]] and Stanhill.

==Economy==
{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}
Formerly cotton and textile machinery were important industries in the town. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} [[Accrington brick|NORI]]s, a type of iron hard engineering brick, were produced nearby in [[Huncoat]] was closed in 2013, but later reopened in 2015. Mills and factories are Accrington's past but there a few factories and garages now occupy the old building.

==Regeneration and investment==
The council has a regeneration plan in place, which will, according to the council, boost the local economy. The plan is to upgrade many old shops, and build a bus station. A memorial for the [[Accrington Pals]] may be built outside the town hall.

The Hyndburn Borough Council plans to spend £10 million to refurbish the town centre, which includes:

*Upgrading all the shops in the town centre.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}
*Building a new bus station. Plans for the new bus station, which was later named '[[George Slynn]]' in honour of the former Hundburn Council leader, were put forward in January 2013 and approved in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accringtonobserver.co.uk/news/local-news/new-accrington-bus-station-open-1293994|title=New Accrington bus station open by 2015|first=Jon|last=Macpherson|year=2013|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accringtonobserver.co.uk/news/local-news/plans-approved-controversial-accrington-bus-7947716|title=Plans approved for controversial Accrington bus station scheme|first=Beth|last=Abbit|year=2014|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bus station was completed during and officially opened on 11 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accringtonobserver.co.uk/news/gallery-new-accrington-bus-station-11598056|title=GALLERY: New Accrington bus station officially opens|first=Jon|last=Macpherson|year=2016|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new station came under heavy criticism with traders of Accrington's Market and town hall, as it would see the old station discontinued, which was situated much closer and provided ease of access for regular customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accringtonobserver.co.uk/news/traders-fears-new-accrington-bus-6252001|title=Traders fears new Accrington bus station could put them out of business|first=Beth|last=Abbit|year=2013|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accringtonobserver.co.uk/news/angry-market-hall-traders-petition-11701657|title=Angry Market Hall traders petition for bus stop after ‘loss of trade’|first=Jon|last=Macpherson|year=2016|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Half of Blackburn Road is being refurbished and is now being made into a more attractive shopping street, upgrading shops, adding more trees, and repaving the pavements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/9462632.Major_work_to_enhance_Blackburn_town_centre_streets_underway/|title=Major work to enhance Blackburn town centre streets underway|website=Lancashire Telegraph|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two new phases are being built, the first one called the Acorn Park, where new houses are being built with balconies and greener spaces, and Phoenix Place, which will also include new housing and the building of a new mosque to help the overcrowding of nearby mosques.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The wood nook area has the highest amount of abandoned housing in Hyndburn, which is also being refurbished and extended for sale to new families.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Geography==
{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}
Accrington is a hill town located at the western edge of the Pennines within a bowl and largely encircled by surrounding hills to heights of 300-400m. The Hyndburn or Accrington Brook flows through the centre of the town. Hill settlements origins were as the economic foci of the district engaging in the spinning and weaving of woolen cloth. Wool, lead and coal were other local industries.
Geographical coordinates: 53° 46' 0&quot; North, 2° 21' 0&quot; West. Height above sea level: there is a [[spot height]] outside the Market Hall which is 133.5m; the bench mark on the side of the neighbouring Town Hall is 441.10 feet. The highest height in the town is 320m which is in [[Baxenden]] and the lowest is the town hall which is at 132.5m. most of the town is around 200m.

==Transport==
The town has strong local travel links as [[Accrington railway station]] lies on the [[East Lancashire Line]] serving trains running locally and trains running from [[Blackpool]] to [[York]]. However, recent changes to the train timetables have been a disservice to Accrington, increasing the journey time to Preston (a vital link to London or Scotland) by up to 1.5 hours. However, there are still buses to Manchester every thirty minutes as well as more frequent services to other towns in east Lancashire. The main road running through the town centre is the [[A680 road|A680]] running from [[Rochdale]] to [[Whalley, Lancashire|Whalley]]. The town is served by junction seven of the [[M65 motorway|M65]] and is linked from the A680 and the [[A56 road|A56]] [[dual carriageway]] which briefly merge; linking to the [[M66 motorway]] heading towards Manchester. The closest airports are [[Manchester Airport]] at {{convert|27|mi}}, [[Blackpool Airport]] at {{convert|28|mi}} and [[Leeds Bradford Airport]] at {{convert|30|mi}}.

There was once a rail link south to Manchester via [[Haslingden]] and [[Bury]], but this was closed in the 1960s as part of cuts following the [[Beeching Report]].

===Governance===
Accrington is represented in parliament as a part of the constituency of Hyndburn. The constituency boundaries do not align exactly with those of the district of the same name.

Hyndburn consists of 16 wards, electing a total of 35 councillors. Due to its size Accrington is represented by a number of wards in the Borough of Hyndburn. The town largely consists of the Milnshaw, Peel, Central, Barnfield and Spring Hill wards, although some parts of those wards are in other towns in the borough.

[[File:Accrington Stanley plaque.JPG|thumb|[[Accrington Stanley F.C.]] wall plaque: &quot;Industry and Prudence Conquer&quot;]]
[[Accrington Stanley F.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accringtonstanley.co.uk/ Accrington Stanley F.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;  entered the [[Football League]] in 1921 with the formation of the old [[Third Division (North)]]; after haunting the lower reaches of English football for forty years, they eventually resigned from the League in 1962, due to financial problems, and folded in 1965. The club was reformed three years later and then worked its way through the non-league divisions to reach the [[Football Conference|Nationwide Conference]] in 2003. In the 2005&amp;ndash;06 season, Stanley, after winning against [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] with three matches to spare, secured a place back in the Football League and the town celebrated with a small parade and honours placed on senior executives of the team. One of the teams relegated&amp;mdash;and thus being replaced by Stanley&amp;mdash;were [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], who were voted into the Football League to replace the previous Accrington Stanley. The football stadium is called the Crown Ground. Until the 2012-13 season, when [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]] entered the league, Accrington was the smallest town in England and Wales with a Football League club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovemytown.co.uk/FootballTeams/FootballTeamsTable5.asp Towns Represented in League Two 2007-8]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bletchley Park''' was the central site for [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Cryptanalysis|codebreakers]] during [[World War II]]. Run by the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS), it regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers. The official historian of World War II British Intelligence has written that the &quot;[[Ultra]]&quot; intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and that without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinsleyLecture&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in [[Milton Keynes]], [[Buckinghamshire]], [[England]] UK, Bletchley Park is now a flourishing heritage attraction. Open seven days a week, it is popular with individuals and families, as well as school groups and tour parties.

Bletchley Park is opposite [[Bletchley railway station]]. It is close to junctions 13 and 14 of the [[M1 motorway|M1]]. Located {{convert|50|mi|km}} northwest of [[London]], the site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]]. [[Browne Willis]] built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down. It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by [[Samuel Lipscomb Seckham]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estate of {{convert|581|acres|ha}} was bought in 1883 by Sir [[Herbert Samuel Leon]], who expanded the then-existing farmhouse&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Edward |first=Legg |title=Early History of Bletchley Park 1235{{ndash}}1937|work=Bletchley Park Trust Historic Guides|number=1|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the present &quot;maudlin and monstrous pile&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison&lt;!--quotation is from the title, but likely there's a page# that can be cited?--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining [[Victorian Gothic]], [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]], and [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque]] styles.

In 1938, the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder planning a housing estate, but in May 1938 Admiral Sir [[Hugh Sinclair]], head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS or [[MI6]]), bought the mansion and {{convert|58|acre|ha}} for use by GC&amp;CS and SIS in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues (inspecting the site under the cover of &quot;Captain Ridley's shooting party&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was Bletchley's geographical centrality. It was almost immediately adjacent to [[Bletchley railway station]], where the &quot;[[Varsity Line]]&quot; between [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]{{snd}}whose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakers{{snd}}met the main [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast railway line]] connecting London, [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]. [[Watling Street]], the main road linking London to the north-west (now the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]) was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby [[Fenny Stratford]].

Bletchley Park was known as &quot;B.P.&quot; to those who worked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Station X&quot; (X = Roman numeral ten), &quot;London Signals Intelligence Centre&quot;, and &quot;[[Government Communications Headquarters]]&quot; were all cover names used during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aldrich|2010|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(The formal posting of the many &quot;Wrens&quot;{{snd}}members of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]{{snd}}working there was to [[RAF Eastcote|HMS Pembroke V]].)

Commander [[Alastair Denniston]] was operational head of GC&amp;CS from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the [[Admiralty]]'s [[Room 40]] (NID25) and the [[War Office]]'s [[MI1]]b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key GC&amp;CS [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] who moved from London to Bletchley Park included [[John Tiltman]], [[Dilly Knox|Dillwyn &quot;Dilly&quot; Knox]], [[Josh Cooper (cryptographer)|Josh Cooper]], and [[Nigel de Grey]]. These people had a variety of backgrounds{{snd}}linguists, chess champions, and crossword experts were common, and in Knox's case [[papyrology]]. The British War Office recruited top solvers of [[cryptic crossword]] puzzles, as these individuals had strong [[lateral thinking]] skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11151478/Could-you-have-been-a-codebreaker-at-Bletchley-Park.html|title=Could you have been a codebreaker at Bletchley Park?|date=10 October 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day Britain declared war on Germany, Denniston wrote to the [[Foreign Office]] about recruiting &quot;men of the professor type&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal networking drove early recruitments, particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=13{{ndash}}23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one 1941 recruiting stratagem ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about &quot;a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=McKay |first=Sinclair |title=Telegraph crossword: Cracking hobby won the day – The boffins of Bletchley cut their teeth on the Telegraph crossword | newspaper = The Telegraph | date = 26 Aug 2010 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/wellbeing/7966268/Telegraph-crossword-Cracking-hobby-won-the-day.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denniston recognised, however, that the enemy's use of electromechanical cipher machines meant that formally trained mathematicians would also be needed;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|2011|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford's [[Peter Twinn]] joined GC&amp;CS in February 1939;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Twinn|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge's [[Alan Turing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hodges |first=Andrew | author-link = Andrew Hodges |year=1992 |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma | publication-place = London |publisher=Vintage |page=148 |isbn=978-0099116417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gordon Welchman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; began training in 1938 and reported to Bletchley the day after war was declared, along with [[John R.F.

This eclectic staff of &quot;[[Boffin]]s and [[Deb (society)|Debs]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=62{{ndash}}71}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused GC&amp;CS to be whimsically dubbed the &quot;Golf, Cheese and Chess Society&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=BBC News UK: Saving Bletchley for the nation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/358913.stm |accessdate=2 February 2011 |date=2 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the female staff in Dilwyn Knox's section sometimes termed &quot;Dilly's Fillies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These &quot;Dilly's girls&quot; included [[Margaret Rock]], Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and [[Mavis Lever]] – who made the first break into the Italian naval traffic and later, along with Margaret Rock, solved a German code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enigma – The battle for the code|last=Sebag-Montefiore|first=Hugh|publisher=Cassell Military Paperbacks|year=2004|isbn=0-304-36662-5|location=London|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit, [[Winston Churchill]] reportedly remarked to Denniston: &quot;I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahn1991|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill. His response was &quot;Action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initial training at the Inter-Service Special Intelligence School set up by [[John Tiltman]] (initially at an RAF depot in Buckingham and later in [[Bedford]]{{snd}}where it was known locally as &quot;the Spy School&quot;)&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith89P205-6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=79, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; staff worked a six-day week, rotating through three shifts: 4{{nbsp}}p.m. to midnight, midnight to 8{{nbsp}}a.m. (the most disliked shift), and 8{{nbsp}}a.m. to 4{{nbsp}}p.m., each with a half-hour meal break. At the end of the third week, a worker went off at 8{{nbsp}}a.m. and came back at 4{{nbsp}}p.m., thus putting in sixteen hours on that last day.&lt;!-- Could we have explicit clarification of the sequence of shifts? Also, how did six-days/week work? Surely the place wasn't idle on Sundays... --&gt; The irregular hours affected workers' health and social life, as well as the routines of the nearby homes at which most staff lodged. The work was tedious and demanded intense concentration; staff got one week's leave four times a year, but some &quot;girls&quot; collapsed and required extended rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|pp=70, 102, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small number of men (e.g. [[General Post Office|Post Office]] experts in Morse code or German) worked part-time.

In January 1945, at the peak of codebreaking efforts, some 10,000 personnel were working at Bletchley and its outstations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Women Codebreakers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=tanya king says: |url=http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/ |title=Women Codebreakers |publisher=Bletchley Park Research |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial percentage of personnel at Bletchley Park, 75%,&lt;ref name=&quot;Women Codebreakers&quot;/&gt; were women; among them were [[Jane Hughes]] who processed information leading to the [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|last battle of the Bismarck]]; and [[Mavis Batey]] and [[Margaret Rock]], who were credited for the [[Abwehr|Abwehr break]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bletchleypark1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/resources/filer.rhtm/261894/web+abwehr2.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Abwehr Enigma Machine |website=Bletchleypark.org.uk |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bletchleypark1&quot;/&gt; Their work achieved official recognition only in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11308744/The-extraordinary-female-codebreakers-of-Bletchley-Park.html|title=The extraordinary female codebreakers of Bletchley Park|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the women came from middle-class backgrounds&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph.co.uk&quot;/&gt; and held degrees in the areas of mathematics, physics and engineering; they were given entry into [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] programs due to the lack of men, who had been sent to war. They performed complex calculation and coding and hence were integral to the computing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/33396 |title=Project MUSE - When Computers Were Women |website=Muse.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rozanne Colchester was a translator at Bletchley Park. She worked there from April 1942 until January 1945 mainly for the Italian air forces Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk/search/record-detail/6221/ |title=Record Detail - Bletchley Park - Roll of Honour |website=Rollofhonour.bletchleypark.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the 'Bletchleyettes', she came from the higher middle class, her father, Air Vice-Marshal Sir Charles Medhurst, being an air attaché in Rome. Before joining the Workforce of the Park, Colchester was moving in high circles “she had met Hitler and been flirted with by Mussolini at an embassy party” writes Sarah Rainey. She joined the Park because she found it thrilling to 'fight'/work for her country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/11308744/The-extraordinary-female-codebreakers-of-Bletchley-Park.html|title=The Telegraph, The extraordinary female codebreakers of Bletchley Park|website=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicely Mayhew]] was recruited straight from university, having graduated from [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford]] in 1944 with a First in French and German, after only two years. She worked in Hut 8, translating decoded German Navy signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lady-mayhew-chgtmfh2w |title=Lady Mayhew &amp;#124; Register &amp;#124; The Times &amp; The Sunday Times |website=Thetimes.co.uk |date=2016-07-21 |accessdate=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Briggs (later called Mrs. Oliver Churchill)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/|title=Women Codebreakers|date=2013-10-03|website=Bletchley Park Research|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked within the Naval Section and was known as one of the best cryptographers. She was also a German scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1MC2d2LPAcC|title=Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park|last=Hinsley|first=Francis Harry|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192801326|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secrecy==
Properly used, the German Enigma and [[Lorenz cipher]]s should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities that made Bletchley's attacks just barely feasible. These vulnerabilities, however, could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures,&lt;ref name=&quot;Milner-Barry1993P92&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Milner-Barry|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany any hint of Bletchley's success. Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britain's &quot;[[Ultra]] secret&quot;{{snd}}higher even than the normally highest classification {{nowrap|''Most&amp;nbsp;Secret''{{thinsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}}}and security was paramount.

All staff signed the [[Official Secrets Act 1939|Official Secrets Act (1939)]] and a 1942 security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: &quot;Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your Hut{{nbsp}}...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=128{{ndash}}9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there were security leaks. [[Jock Colville]], the Assistant Private Secretary to [[Winston Churchill]], recorded in his diary on 31 July 1941, that the newspaper proprietor [[Lord Camrose]] had discovered Ultra and that security leaks &quot;increase in number and seriousness&quot;.{{sfn|Colville|1985|p=422}} Without doubt, the most serious of these was that Bletchley Park had been infiltrated by [[John Cairncross]], the notorious Soviet mole and member of the [[Cambridge Spy Ring]], who leaked Ultra material to Moscow.{{sfn|Smith|2015|pp=81-82}}

==Early work==
[[File:Information Flow Bletchley Park Enigma Messages.png|thumbnail|right|upright=1.5| Flow of information from an intercepted Enigma message&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Sale |first=Tony | author-link = Tony Sale |title=Information flow from German ciphers to Intelligence to Allied commanders. |url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/infoflow/infoflowie.htm |accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The first personnel of the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939. The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room; the top floor was allocated to [[MI6]]. Construction of the wooden huts began in late 1939, and Elmers School, a neighbouring boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=2{{ndash}}3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States joined the war, a number of American cryptographers were posted to [[Hut&amp;nbsp;3]], and from May 1943 onwards there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1993|pp=71, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(See [[1943 BRUSA Agreement]].) In contrast, the [[Soviet Union]] was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities{{snd}} a reflection of Churchill's distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat.

The only direct enemy damage to the site was done 20{{ndash}}21{{nbsp}}November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for [[Bletchley railway station]]; Hut{{nbsp}}4, shifted two feet off its foundation, was winched back into place as
work inside continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Bletchley Park National Codes Centre |title=The Cafe in Hut 4 | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content//index.rhtm | accessdate =3 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence reporting==
[[File:Ultra Hut3 Graph.png|thumbnail|upright=1.5| Signals to Commands Abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1999|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Non-naval Enigma messages were deciphered in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;6]], followed by translation, indexing and cross-referencing, in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;3]]. Only then was it sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries, and later on to high-level commanders in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|pp=70{{ndash}}81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval Enigma deciphering was in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;8]], with translation in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;4]].
Verbatim translations were sent only to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] (NID) of the Admiralty's Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC), supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross-references from a knowledge store of German naval technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calvocoressi 2001 29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher, which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network. Feeding these back to Hut{{nbsp}}8 provided excellent &quot;cribs&quot; for [[Known-plaintext attack]]s on the daily naval Enigma key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|2011|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Listening stations==

Initially, a [[radio|wireless]] room was established at Bletchley Park.
It was set up in the mansion's water tower under the code name &quot;Station&amp;nbsp;X&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;WatsonP307&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1993|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole. The &quot;X&quot; is the [[Roman numeral]] &quot;ten&quot;, this being the Secret Intelligence Service's tenth such station. Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby [[Whaddon, Buckinghamshire#Whaddon Hall|Whaddon Hall]] to avoid drawing attention to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pidgeon|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, other listening stations{{snd}}the [[Y-stations]], such as the ones at [[Chicksands]] in Bedfordshire, [[Beaumanor Hall]], Leicestershire (where the headquarters of the War Office &quot;Y&quot; Group was located) and [[Beeston Hill Y Station]] in Norfolk{{snd}}gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley. Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle [[despatch rider]]s or (later) by teleprinter.

==Additional buildings==
The wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Watson |first=Bob |title=Appendix: How the Bletchley Park buildings took shape |pages=306–310}} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=149–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a hut's number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original &quot;Hut&quot; designation.&lt;ref&gt;Some of this information has been derived from [http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/history/RollofHonour.rhtm The Bletchley Park Trust's Roll of Honour].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work on specific countries' signals==

===German signals===
[[File:bp-polish-codebreakers-plaque.jpg|thumb|Bletchley's Polish Memorial, commemorating &quot;the [prewar] work of [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy Różycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], mathematicians of the [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish intelligence service]], in first breaking the Enigma code. Their work greatly assisted the Bletchley Park code breakers and contributed to the Allied victory in World War{{nbsp}}II.&quot;]]

Most German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine]].

Five weeks before the outbreak of war, Warsaw's [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] revealed [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|its achievements]] in breaking Enigma to astonished French and British personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Milner-Barry1993P92&quot;/&gt; The British used the Poles' information and techniques, and the [[Polish Enigma doubles|Enigma clone]] sent to them in August 1939, which greatly increased their (previously very limited) success in decrypting Enigma messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Twinn|1993|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RebuiltBombeFrontView.jpg|thumb|right|The working rebuilt bombe, built by a team led by [[John Harper (computer engineer)|John Harper]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jharper.demon.co.uk/bombe1.htm] {{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and switched on by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|the Duke of Kent]], patron of the [[British Computer Society]], on 17 July 2008]]

The [[bombe]] was an electromechanical device whose function was to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military [[Telecommunications network|networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2004|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Carter |first=Frank |title=From Bombe Stops to Enigma Keys |year=2004 |publisher=Bletchley Park Codes Centre |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/bombestops.pdf |accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108030414/http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk:80/content/bombestops.pdf |archivedate=8 January 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its pioneering design was developed by [[Alan Turing]] (with an important contribution from Gordon Welchman) and the machine was engineered by [[Harold Keen|Harold 'Doc' Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]]. Each machine was about {{convert|7|ft|m}} high and wide, {{convert|2|ft|m}} deep and weighed about a ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Ellsbury |first=Graham |title=The Turing Bombe: What it was and how it worked |chapter=2.

At its peak, GC&amp;CS was reading approximately 4,000 messages per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Carter |first=Frank |title=The Turing Bombe |journal=The Rutherford Journal |url=http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/article030108.html |issn=1177-1380}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a hedge against enemy attack&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Bletchley Park Jewels |chapter=Outstations from the Park |url=http://www.mkheritage.co.uk/bpt/outstations/outstations.htm |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; most bombes were dispersed to installations at [[Adstock]] and [[Wavendon]] (both later supplanted by installations at [[Stanmore]] and [[Eastcote]]), and [[Gayhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Toms |first=Susan |title=Enigma and the Eastcote connection |year=2005 |url=http://www.ruislip.co.uk/eastcotemod/enigma.htm |accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Welchman|1997|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luftwaffe]] messages were the first to be read in quantity. The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken. When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the [[US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombe]] that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war. Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.

[[File:Colossus.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Mark 2 Colossus computer. The ten Colossi were the world's first (semi-) programmable electronic computers, the first having been built in 1943]]

The [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|Lorenz messages]] were codenamed ''Tunny'' at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks were used for high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders. With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the [[Testery]] (named after [[Ralph Tester]], its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form. They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his team at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]]. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944. Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of 1 June in time for [[Normandy landings|D-day]]. Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built. The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the [[Newmanry]] after its head [[Max Newman]].

Bletchley's work was essential to defeating the [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and to the British naval victories in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] and the [[Battle of North Cape]]. In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the [[North African Campaign|North African desert campaign]] against German forces under General [[Erwin Rommel]]. General Sir [[Claude Auchinleck]] wrote that were it not for Ultra, &quot;Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo&quot;. While not changing the events,&lt;!--maybe instead we should list more situations in which events WERE changed--&gt; &quot;[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]&quot; decrypts featured prominently in the story of [[Operation Salaam|Operation SALAM]], [[László Almásy]]'s mission across  [[Western Desert (Egypt)|the desert]] behind Allied lines in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Kuno, Michael Rolke and András Zboray, [http://fjexpeditions.com/resources/salam/operation_salam.htm Operation SALAM] - László Almásy’s most daring Mission in the Desert War, Belleville, München, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Normandy landings]] on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany's fifty-eight Western-front divisions.

===Italian signals===
{{see also|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}
Italian signals had been of interest since Italy's attack on Abyssinia in 1935.
During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the [[Royal Italian Navy|Italian Navy]] used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.
When Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were &quot;wholesale changes&quot; in Italian codes and cyphers.

Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women (&quot;Dilly's girls&quot;), who included [[Margaret Rock]], Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and [[Mavis Lever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grey|2012|pp=132{{ndash}}3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mavis Batey|Mavis Lever]] solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy's operational plans before the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in 1941, leading to a British victory.

Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Cunningham]] visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Batey |first=Mavis | author-link = Mavis Batey |title=Breaking Italian Naval Enigma |year=2011 |page=81}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|pp=79–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On entering World War II in June 1940, the [[Italy|Italians]] were using book codes for most of their military messages. The exception was the [[Italian Navy]], which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the [[C-38 (cipher machine)|C-38]] version of the [[Boris Hagelin]] [[Rotor machine|rotor-based]] [[cipher machine]], particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hinsley |first=Sir Harry | author-link = Harry Hinsley |title=The Influence of ULTRA in the Second World War |origyear=1993 |year=1996 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/Historical/hinsley.html |accessdate=23 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706194507/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/Historical/hinsley.html |archivedate=6 July 2012}} Transcript of a lecture given on Tuesday 19 October 1993 at Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;
As a consequence, [[James Ramsay Montagu Butler|JRM Butler]] recruited his former student [[Bernard Willson]] to join a team with two others in Hut{{nbsp}}4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Dakin |first=Alec Naylor |year=1993 |title=The Z Watch in Hut 4, Part I }} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=50{{ndash}}56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wilkinson |first=Patrick |year=1993 |title=Italian naval ciphers}} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=61–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1941, Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommel's [[Afrika Korps]]. This led to increased shipping losses and, from reading the intercepted traffic, the team learnt that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the [[Luftwaffe]] in North Africa reduced by 90%.&lt;ref name=BPJuly41&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/index/july1941.rhtm |title=July 1941 |publisher=Bletchley Park |accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes.&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Middle East Intelligence Centre (MEIC) was set up in Cairo in 1939. When Italy entered the war in June 1940, delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo. A Combined Bureau Middle East (CBME) was set up in November, though the Middle East authorities made &quot;increasingly bitter complaints&quot; that [[GC&amp;CS]] was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers. However, the principle of concentrating high-grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley, Harry]] ''British Intelligence in the Second World War, Volume One: Its Influence on Strategy and Operations'' (1979, Her Majesties Stationery Office, London) pp 191{{ndash}}221, 570{{ndash}}2 ISBN 0 11 630933 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Chadwick]] started cryptanalysis work in 1942 on Italian signals at the naval base 'HMS Nile' in Alexandria. Later, he was with GC&amp;CS; in the Heliopolis Museum, Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens, Alexandria.

===Soviet signals===
Soviet signals had been studied since the 1920s. In 1939{{ndash}}40, [[John Tiltman]] (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at [[Sarafand al-Amar|Sarafand]] in Palestine. Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&amp;CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13–34}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese signals===
An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], then [[Kilindini Harbour|Kilindini]], [[Mombasa]], Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Michael |title=Mombasa was base for high-level UK espionage operation |url=http://www.coastweek.com/codes.htm |work=coastweek.com |publisher=Coastweek |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the [[Wireless Experimental Centre]] at [[Delhi]], India.

In early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war's end. Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;7]], under [[John Tiltman]].

By mid-1945, well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at [[Arlington Hall]], Virginia. In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: &quot;Only now are the British codebreakers (like [[John Tiltman]], [[Hugh Foss]], and [[Eric Nave]]) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2001|pp=127{{ndash}}51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war==

===Continued secrecy===
After the War, the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=129{{ndash}}35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as &quot;the geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, occasional mentions of the work performed at Bletchley Park slipped the censor's net and appeared in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thirsk|2008|pp=61–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of [[F. W. Winterbotham|F.{{nbsp}}W. Winterbotham's]] ''The Ultra Secret'' (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Winterbotham |first=F. W. | author-link = F.W. Winterbotham |title=The Ultra Secret |place=London |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; public discussion of Bletchley's work finally became possible (though even today some former staff still consider themselves bound to silence)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Withers-Green |first=Sheila |title=audiopause audio:&lt;!--&lt;&lt;regularize this cite--&gt; I made a promise that I wouldn't say anything |year=2010 |url=http://audioboo.fm/boos/176850-i-made-a-promise-that-i-wouldn-t-say-anything-sheila-withers-green-bpark2010?playlist_direction=forward |accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2009 the British government announced that Bletchley personnel would be recognised with a commemorative badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5789263/Enigma-codebreakers-to-be-honoured-finally.html |title=Enigma codebreakers to be honoured finally |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site===
After the war, the site passed through a succession of hands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9678.asp|title=Solo Travel Summer Home Preparation|website=Bellaonline.com|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saw a number of uses, including as a teacher-training college and local [[General Post Office|GPO]] headquarters. By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment.

In February 1992, the [[Milton Keynes Borough Council]] declared most of the Park a conservation area, and the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum. The site opened to visitors in 1993, and was formally inaugurated by HRH The Duke of Kent as Chief Patron in July 1994. In 1999 the land owners, the [[Office of Government Commerce|Property Advisors to the Civil Estate]] and [[BT Group|BT]], granted a lease the Trust giving the Trust control over most of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/recent.rhtm|title=Bletchley Park History|author=Bletchley Park Trust.|website=Bletchleypark.org.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 2014 saw the completion of an £8 million restoration project, which was marked by a visit from [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]]. The Duchess' paternal grandmother, Valerie, and Valerie's twin sister, Mary (née Glassborow), both worked at Bletchley Park during the war. The twin sisters worked as Foreign Office Civilians in [[Hut 6]], where they managed the interception of enemy and neutral diplomatic signals for decryption.

In October 2005, American billionaire [[Sidney Frank]] donated £500,000 to Bletchley Park Trust to fund a new Science Centre dedicated to [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/274566 Action This Day], Bletchley Park News, 28 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, a letter to [[The Times]] from more than a hundred academics condemned the neglect of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/letters/article4385384.ece |title=Saving the heritage of Bletchley Park (Letter) |work=[[The Times]]}}&lt;!--need date--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7517874.stm &quot;Neglect of Bletchley condemned&quot;], [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], [[IBM]], and other technology firms announced a fund-raising campaign to repair the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10034884-83.html|title=PGP, IBM help Bletchley Park raise funds|author=Tom Espiner|date=8 September 2008|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November 2008 it was announced that [[English Heritage]] would donate £300,000 to help maintain the buildings at Bletchley Park, and that they were in discussions regarding the donation of a further £600,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7710966.stm &quot;New lifeline for Bletchley Park&quot;], [[BBC News]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, the Bletchley Park Trust received a £4.6m [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] grant to be used &quot;to complete the restoration of the site, and to tell its story to the highest modern standards&quot; on the condition that £1.7m of 'match funding' is raised by the Bletchley Park Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-15171726 |title=Bletchley Park wins #pound;4.6m Heritage Lottery Fund grant |work=BBC News |date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=It’s Happening!: The Long-Awaited Restoration of Historic Bletchley Park |publisher=Bletchley Park Trust |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org/content/contact/donation/support.rhtm |accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just weeks later, Google contributed £550k&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Google gives £550k to Bletchley Park |publisher=The Register |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/15/google_give_half_a_mill_to_computer_museum/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by June 2012 the trust had successfully raised £2.4m to unlock the grants to restore Huts 3 and 6, as well as develop its exhibition centre in Block C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/06/27/bletchley_park_raises_7_million|title=Bletchley Park gets £7.4m to tart up WWII code-breaking huts|website=Theregister.co.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|The National Museum of Computing}}
[[File:ColossusRebuild 11.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anthony Sale|Tony Sale]] supervising the breaking of an enciphered message with the completed [[Colossus computer]] rebuild in 2006]]

The National Museum of Computing is housed in Block H, which is rented from the Bletchley Park Trust. Its Colossus and Tunny galleries tell an important part of allied breaking of German codes during World War II. There is a working reconstruction of a [[Colossus computer]] that was used on the high-level [[Lorenz cipher]], codenamed ''Tunny'' by the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;codesandciphers.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/rebuild.htm|title=Colossus Rebuild - Tony Sale|website=Codesandciphers.org.uk|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum, which opened in 2007, is an independent voluntary organisation that is governed by its own board of trustees. Its aim  is &quot;To collect and restore computer systems particularly those developed in Britain and to enable people to explore that collection for inspiration, learning and enjoyment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Mission Statement of The National Museum of Computing |publisher=CodesandCiphers Heritage Trust |url=http://www.tnmoc.org/about-us |accessdate=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its many exhibits, the museum displays the story of computing through the mainframes of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of personal computing in the 1980s. It has a policy of having as many of the exhibits as possible in full working order.

The Colossus and Tunny galleries are open daily. The rest of the Museum is open to the public every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons and most bank holidays, and by appointment for groups only, at other times. There are guided tours on Tuesday afternoons. There is a modest admission charge to the museum to help cover overheads.

'''Agner Krarup Erlang''' (1 January 1878 – 3 February 1929) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[engineer]], who invented the fields of [[teletraffic engineering|traffic engineering]] and [[queueing theory]].

By the time of his relatively early death at the age of 51, Erlang had created the field of [[PSTN|telephone networks]] analysis. His early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the [[Erlang formula]], which became a foundational element of present-day [[telecommunication]] network studies.

== Life ==

Erlang was born at Lønborg, near [[Tarm]], in [[Jutland]].  He was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of [[Thomas Fincke]] on his mother's side.  At age 14, he passed the Preliminary Examination of the [[University of Copenhagen]] with distinction, after receiving dispensation to take it because he was younger than the usual minimum age.  For the next two years he taught alongside his father.

A distant relative provided free board and lodging, and Erlang prepared for and took the University of [[Copenhagen]] entrance examination in 1896, and passed with distinction.  He won a scholarship to the University and majored in [[mathematics]], and also studied [[astronomy]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].  He graduated in 1901 with an MA and over the next 7 years taught at several schools. He maintained his interest in mathematics, and received an award for a paper that he submitted to the University of Copenhagen.

He was a member of the Danish Mathematicians' Association (TBMI) and through this met amateur mathematician [[Johan Jensen (mathematician)|Johan Jensen]], the Chief Engineer of the [[Copenhagen Telephone Company]] (KTAS in Danish), an [[Corporate spin-off|offshoot]] of the [[International Bell Telephone Company]].  Erlang worked for the CTC (KTAS) from 1908 for almost 20 years, until his death in Copenhagen after an abdominal operation.

He was an associate of the British [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]].

== Contributions ==

While working for the CTC, Erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service.  His thinking went further by finding how many [[Switchboard operator|telephone operators]] were needed to handle a given volume of calls.  Most [[telephone exchange]]s then used human operators and [[telephone switchboard|cord boards]] to switch [[telephone call]]s by means of jack plugs.

Out of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher.  He would conduct measurements and was prepared to climb into street [[manhole]]s to do so. &lt;!-- He famously said that this was a &quot;no brainer.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The actual quote in Danish w/translation would be desired. --&gt; He was also an expert in the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly [[logarithm]]s.  He devised new calculation methods for certain forms of tables.

He developed his theory of telephone traffic over several years.  His significant publications include:
* In 1909 - &quot;The Theory of Probabilities and Telephone Conversations&quot; - which proves that the [[Poisson distribution]] applies to random telephone traffic.
* In 1917 - &quot;Solution of some Problems in the Theory of Probabilities of Significance in Automatic Telephone Exchanges&quot; - which contains his classic formulae for [[Grade of service#Erlang's lost call assumptions|call loss]] and waiting time.

These and other notable papers were translated into English, French and German.  His papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field.  One researcher from [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] is said to have learned Danish to study them.

The [[BT Group plc|British Post Office]] accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities.

A unit of measurement, statistical distribution and programming language listed below have been named in his honour.
