'''Allan Dwan''' (3 April 1885 – 28 December 1981) was a pioneering Canadian-born American motion picture director, producer and screenwriter.

==Early life==
Born '''Joseph Aloysius Dwan''' in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada, Dwan, was the younger son of commercial traveller of woolen clothing Joseph Michael Dwan (1857-1917) and his wife Mary Jane Dwan, ''née'' Hunt. The family moved to the United States when he was seven years old, on December 4, 1892 by ferry from Windsor to Detroit, according to his naturalization petition of August 1939. His elder brother, Leo Garnet Dwan (1883-1964), became a physician. At the [[University of Notre Dame]], Allan Dwan studied engineering and began working for a lighting company in Chicago. However, he had a strong interest in the fledgling motion picture industry and when [[Essanay Studios]] offered him the opportunity to become a scriptwriter, he took the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kevin Brownlow 1968&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Brownlow, Kevin |title=The Parade's Gone By . . . |publisher=Ballantine Books, Inc. |location=New York |year=1969 |page=111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, some of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] movie makers began to spend winters in California where the climate allowed them to continue productions requiring warm weather. Soon, a number of movie companies worked there year-round and, in 1911, Dwan began working part-time in Hollywood. While still in New York, in 1917 he was the founding president of the East Coast chapter of the [[Motion Picture Directors Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frankenstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Fournier |first=Pierre |url= http://io9.gizmodo.com/5706057/the-first-frankenstein-of-the-movies |title=The first Frankenstein of the movies |work=[[io9]] |date=2010-12-04 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Dwan operated [[Flying A Studios]] in [[La Mesa, California]] from August 1911 to July 1912.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eastcountymagazine.org/node/6833|title=La mesa to honor its tinseltown roots aug. 12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lamesa.patch.com/articles/100-simple-melodramas-were-made-in-la-mesa-100-years-ago|title=Proto-Hollywood: 100 Melodramas Were Made In La Mesa 100 Years Ago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flying A was one of the first motion pictures studios in California history. On 12 August 2011, a plaque was unveiled on the Wolff building at Third Avenue and La Mesa Boulevard commemorating Dwan and the [[Flying A Studios]] origins in [[La Mesa, California]].

After making a series of westerns and comedies, Dwan directed fellow Canadian-American [[Mary Pickford]] in several very successful movies as well as her husband, [[Douglas Fairbanks]], notably in the acclaimed 1922 ''[[Robin Hood (1922 film)|Robin Hood]]''. Dwan directed [[Gloria Swanson]] in eight feature films, and one short film made in the short-lived sound-on-film process [[Phonofilm]]. This short, also featuring [[Thomas Meighan]] and [[Henri de la Falaise]], was produced as a joke, for the 26 April 1925 &quot;Lambs' Gambol&quot; for [[The Lambs]], with the film showing Swanson crashing the all-male club.

Following the introduction of the [[sound film|talkies]], Dwan directed child-star [[Shirley Temple]] in ''[[Heidi]]'' (1937) and ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938 film)|Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' (1938).

Dwan helped launch the career of two other successful Hollywood directors, [[Victor Fleming]], who went on to direct ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'', and [[Marshall Neilan]], who became an actor, director, writer and producer. Over a long career spanning almost 50 years, Dwan directed 125 motion pictures, some of which were highly acclaimed, such as the 1949 box office hit, ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]''. He directed his last movie in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/SearchResult.aspx?s=&amp;retailCheck=&amp;Type=PN&amp;CatID=DATABIN_DIRECTOR&amp;ID=11207&amp;AN_ID=&amp;searchedFor=Allan_Dwan_ | publisher=American Film Institute | title=Allan Dwan, Filmography | accessdate=December 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Los Angeles at the age of ninety-six, and is interred in the [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], [[Mission Hills, California]].

Dwan has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6263 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].
