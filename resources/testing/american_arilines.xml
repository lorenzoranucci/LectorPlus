== History ==
{{Main|History of American Airlines}}
American Airlines was started in 1930 via a union of more than eighty miniature airlines.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|last=Koenig|first=David|title=American Airlines parent seeks Ch. 11 protection|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gqSFH2Ou81RHegJYXJtAeU9CkyhA?docId=c6952820f230470692fc37e00d9d2d36 |accessdate=7 December 2011 |newspaper=Google News |date= November 29, 2011|agency=Associated Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204004443/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gqSFH2Ou81RHegJYXJtAeU9CkyhA?docId=c6952820f230470692fc37e00d9d2d36|archivedate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two organizations from which American Airlines was originated were [[Robertson Aircraft Corporation]] and [[Colonial Air Transport]].  The former was first formed in Missouri in 1921, with both being merged in 1929 into holding company [[The Aviation Corporation]].  This in turn, was made in 1930 into an operating company and rebranded as [[American Airways]].  In 1934, when new laws and attrition of mail contracts forced many airlines to reorganize, the corporation redid its routes into a connected system, and was renamed American Airlines.  Between 1970 and 2000, the company grew into being an international carrier, purchasing [[Trans World Airlines]] in 2001.

In 2011, due to a downturn in the airline industry, American Airlines and [[AMR Corporation]] filed for bankruptcy protection.  In 2013, [[US Airways]] acquired American Airlines. Eventually operations were merged under one operating certificate to create the largest United States airline which kept the American Airlines brand name.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/topic/American-Airlines&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate affairs==

===Headquarters===
American Airlines is headquartered in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], adjacent to the [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/corporateInformation/facts/structure.jsp Corporate Structure].&quot; ''American Airlines''.

===U.S. federal government subsidies===
As of November 2013 American Airlines and American Eagle received $10,011,836 in annual federal subsidies for [[Essential Air Service]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dot.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/Subsidized%20EAS%20web%20report%20for%20non-Alaska%20communities-Nov%202013.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714161624/http://www.dot.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/Subsidized%20EAS%20web%20report%20for%20non-Alaska%20communities-Nov%202013.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These subsidies are awarded by public tender and ensure that small, rural airports can be connected to the national air network.

===Labor unions===

===Environmental record===
Violations occurring over a 4½ year period—from October 1993 to July 1998—targeted American Airlines for using high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around the country. Under the federal [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] high sulfur fuel cannot be used in motor vehicles. American Airlines promptly identified and corrected these violations of the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=American Airlines Will Make Clean Air Improvements at Logan Airport Reports to EPA the Use of Illegal High Sulfur Fuel in Motor Vehicles|url=http://epa.gov/NE/pr/1999/072099b.html |work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=July 19, 1999|accessdate=January 25, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707175156/http://epa.gov/ne/pr/1999/072099b.html|archivedate=July 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Airlines' wastewater treatment plant [[recycle]]s water used at the base to wash aircraft, process rinse water tanks, and irrigate landscape. That alone has saved almost $1&amp;nbsp;million since 2002. In addition to that, American Airlines has also won the award for the reduction of [[hazardous waste]] that saved them $229,000 after a $2,000 investment. A bar code system is used to track hazardous waste. It has led to reduction of waste by 50 percent since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;envqual&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_2006_May_11/ai_n16359869|title=American Airlines Receives Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's Governor's Award |work=Airline Industry Information |date=May 11, 2006}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate identity==

===Logo===
[[File:American Airlines logo.svg|thumb|American Airlines' fourth logo, used from 1967 until 2013]]
In 1931, Goodrich Murphy, an American employee, designed the AA logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/2015/05/tales-era-airlines-knew-good-design/|title=Tales From an Era When Airlines Knew Good Design |publisher=WIRED.com |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The logo was redesigned by [[Massimo Vignelli]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vignelli.com/home/identity/aa.html |title=Vignelli Associates About the AA Logo |publisher=Vignelli.com |accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logosdesigners.com/#massimo-vignelli|title=iconic logo designers|work=logosdesigners.com|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, in 1997, American Airlines was able to make its logo Internet-compatible by buying the domain AA.com. ''AA'' is also American's two-letter [[IATA]] [[airline codes|airline designator]].

On January 16, 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign with FutureBrand dubbed, &quot;A New American&quot;. This included a new logo replacing the logo used since 1967. American Airlines calls the new logo the &quot;Flight Symbol&quot;, incorporating the eagle, star, and &quot;A&quot; of the classic logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com/newamerican?anchorLocation=HomePageHero1&amp;reportedTitle=Becoming%20a%20new%20American&amp;reportedPosition=0&amp;url=undefined&amp;_locale=en_US&amp;repositoryName=undefined&amp;repositoryId=undefined |title=Becoming a new American |publisher=aa.com |date= |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Livery===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
American's early [[aircraft livery|liveries]] varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an [[eagle]] painted on the fuselage. The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of [[Envoy Air|American Eagle Airlines]]. Propeller aircraft featured an [[international orange]] lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

[[File:American Airlines Astrojet N951AA.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737 in the Astrojet livery]]

In the late 1960s, American commissioned designer [[Massimo Vignelli]] to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple &quot;AA&quot; logo, without an eagle, on the tail; instead, Vignelli created a highly stylized eagle, which remained the company's logo until 2013. In 1999, American painted a new [[Boeing 757]] (N679AN) in its 1959 international orange livery. One [[Boeing 777]] and one Boeing 757 were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail, in support of [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]]. One Boeing 757 is painted with a yellow ribbon on the tailfin on the aircraft and on the side of the body says &quot;Flagship Independence&quot;. American Eagle, the airline's regional airline has the same special livery on ERJ-145 aircraft.

[[File:AA Flagship Freedom.JPG|thumb|left|AA &quot;Flagship Freedom&quot; [[Boeing 757-200]], labeled with a &quot;[[Yellow ribbon|yellow awareness ribbon]]&quot; symbol, representing support of the [[United States Armed Forces]] overseas operations.]]
On January 17, 2013, American unveiled a new livery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-american-airlines-livery-20130117,0,198977.story |title=American Airlines unveils new logo, livery |work=Chicago Tribune |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before then, American had been the only major U.S. airline to leave most of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. This was because C. R. Smith hated painted aircraft, and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industry.bnet.com/travel/1000148/paint-vs-bare-metal-on-airplanes/ |title=Delta, Air Canada Among Carriers Weighing Benefit of Paint Stripping |publisher=Industry.bnet.com |date=8 October 2008 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign dubbed, &quot;The New American&quot;. In addition to a new logo, American Airlines introduced a new livery for its fleet. The airline calls the new livery and branding &quot;a clean and modern update&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The current design features an abstract American flag on the tail, along with a silver-painted fuselage, as a throw-back to the old livery. The new design was painted by [[Leading Edge Aviation Services]] in [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahles |first=Andrea |url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/01/17/4556563/american-airlines-shows-off-new.html |title=Star-Telegram 18 January 2013: &quot;American Airlines shows off new look for new era&quot; |publisher=Star-telegram.com |date=January 18, 2013 |accessdate=January 29, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131514074500/http://www.star-telegram.com/2013/01/17/4556563/american-airlines-shows-off-new.html |archivedate=January 1, 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doug Parker, the incoming CEO indicated that the new livery could be short-lived, stating that &quot;maybe we need to do something slightly different than that ... The only reason this is an issue now is because they just did it right in the middle, which kind of makes it confusing, so that gives us an opportunity, actually, to decide if we are going to do something different because we have so many airplanes to paint&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;King, Eric. (2013-03-28) [http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/American-Airlines-New-Livery-Soon-Could-Become-Its-Old-Look-200532901.html American Airline's New Livery Soon Could Become Its Old Look | NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth]. Nbcdfw.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end, American let its employees decide the new livery's fate. On an internal website for employees, American posted two options, one the new livery and one a modified version of the old livery. All of the [[American Airlines Group]] employees (including US Airways and other affiliates) were able to vote. American ultimately decided to keep the new look. Parker announced that American would keep a US Airways heritage aircraft in the fleet, with plans to add a heritage TWA aircraft and a heritage American plane with the old livery.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

*[[Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport]] – American closed its San Juan hub in 2012. American used San Juan as a connection point for Caribbean destinations using ATR-72 commuter aircraft.

* [[San Jose International Airport]] – American closed its San Jose hub in the early 2000s. The hub was begun on December 2, 1988 with planned growth to 1991, soon after American acquired Air Cal and was seeking a Northern California hub either in San Jose or San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-05/business/fi-2747_1_san-jose-airport|title=American Airlines Selects San Jose Airport for Hub|first=ROBERT E.|last=DALLOS|date=5 October 1988|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The San Jose hub was inherited with the acquisition of [[Reno Air]].

American operated interchange flight services in conjunction with Alaska Airlines during the 1970s between Texas and Alaska during the construction of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. This interchange agreement allowed for single, no change of aircraft service between Houston, Texas and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Anchorage, Alaska and Fairbanks, Alaska. The round trip routing of this interchange flight was Houston-Dallas/Fort Worth-Seattle-Anchorage-Fairbanks with Seattle, Washington serving as the interchange point where flight and cabin crews were changed from one airline to the other. Boeing 727-200 jetliners provided by both American and Alaska Airlines were utilized to provide this interchange service.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

As of July 2016, American Airlines operates a fleet of 952 aircraft, making it the largest commercial fleet in the world. It operates a mix of Airbus, Boeing, Embraer, and McDonnell Douglas aircraft.

Over two thirds of American's aircraft are narrow-bodies, mainly Airbus A320 series and Boeing 737-800. It also operates Boeing 757, Embraer 190 and McDonnell Douglas MD-82/83, but most of them are planned to be phased out within five years.

Its wide-body aircraft are mainly Boeing airliners. It is [[List of Boeing 767 operators#Current airline operators|the third-largest operator]] of the Boeing 767 series and [[List of Boeing 777 operators#Orders and deliveries|the fifth-largest operator]] of the Boeing 777 series. It also operates the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A330.

The cabin features eight suites that are laid out in a 1-2-1 reverse herringbone configuration with direct aisle access.  Each suite features an 80-inch (203&amp;nbsp;cm) long fully lie-flat seat with swivel capabilities (enabling the passenger to set up a dedicated work space), a 17-inch (43&amp;nbsp;cm) touchscreen monitor, and multiple AC power outlets and USB ports.

An older version of the Flagship Suite is available on select Boeing 777-200ERs. However, these aircraft are in the process of being retrofitted, with the first class section being replaced with an all-new, expanded business class. These aircraft feature 16 suites in a 1-2-1 configuration with direct aisle access, privacy dividers, and a 78-inch (198&amp;nbsp;cm) long fully lie-flat seat with swivel capabilities. Each seat comes equipped with an 8.4 inch tilting touchscreen monitor and a DC power outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/ourPlanes/boeing777.jsp#!first-class|title=American Airlines Boeing 777 First Class|publisher=aa.com|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American has dedicated 17 [[Airbus A321]]s in its fleet for the specific use of flying transcontinental routes between New York JFK–Los Angeles and New York JFK–San Francisco. These aircraft offer two premium cabins, First Class and Business Class,  which are unique among domestic mainline aircraft in American's fleet:

These seats are similar to the ones in the Business Class cabin on the Boeing 777-300ER. Transcontinental First Class passengers receive exclusive amenities such as Flagship check-in at New York JFK and LAX, and an amenity kit that is identical to the one given to international Business Class passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;A321T&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/ourPlanes/airbus321t.jsp|title=American Airlines Airbus A321 Transcontinental Business Class|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When such aircraft are used on flights to international destinations including Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean, the First Class cabin is branded as Business Class. Seats range from 19–21 inches (48–53&amp;nbsp;cm) in width and have 37–42 inches (94–106&amp;nbsp;cm) of pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripadvisor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seatguru.com/airlines/American_Airlines/fleetinfo.php|title=American Airlines Planes and Seat Maps|publisher=tripadvisor.com|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dining options include free snacks, beverages, and alcohol on all flights, with three-course meals offered on flights 900 miles (1,448&amp;nbsp;km) or longer (select routes under 900 miles offer meal service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/duringFlight/dining/premium-cabin.jsp|title=First and Business Class Dining|publisher=aa.com|accessdate=May 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premium Economy===
On December 9, 2015, American announced a new Premium Economy product for most long-haul widebody aircraft. This new product will debut on the new 787-9s in late 2016 and will be available on the new A350s in 2018. It will also be retrofitted to all other widebody aircraft within the next three years, excluding 767s due to their upcoming retirement. The seats will be wider than standard Main Cabin seats and will offer 38&quot; of pitch, 2&quot; more than Main Cabin Extra seats, as well as a footrest. Premium Economy customers will also get two free checked bags, priority boarding, and enhanced food and drink service including free alcohol. This product will make American Airlines the first U.S. carrier to offer a four-cabin aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;upgrd.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://upgrd.com/blogs/doublewidesfly/american-airlines-premium-economy-the-only-north-american-carrier-to-offer-a-4-cabin-aircraft.html|title=American Airlines Premium Economy - The Only North American Carrier to Offer a 4 Cabin Aircraft|work=upgrd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main Cabin Extra===
American's economy plus product (not to be confused with premium economy), Main Cabin Extra, is available on most of the mainline fleet and [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional aircraft with more than 50 seats. Exceptions include a majority of former [[US Airways]] aircraft (as of May 2015), [[US Airways Express]] regional aircraft, and a handful of 777-200ERs that have yet to be retrofitted. Seats range from 17.2–18.5 inches (44–47&amp;nbsp;cm) in width and have 34–38 inches (86–97&amp;nbsp;cm) of pitch, which is 4–6 more inches of pitch offered in regular economy seating.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripadvisor&quot;/&gt; American will retain Main Cabin Extra when the new Premium Economy product enters service in late 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;upgrd.com&quot;/&gt;

===Main Cabin===
Main Cabin is American's economy product, and is found on all mainline and regional aircraft in its fleet. Seats range from 17–18.5 inches (43–47&amp;nbsp;cm) in width and have 30–32 inches (76–81&amp;nbsp;cm) of pitch.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripadvisor&quot;/&gt; Newer aircraft, including all Boeing 777-300ER, refurbished Boeing 777-200ER's, all Boeing 787 Dreamliners, all Airbus A330s, all Airbus A319s and Airbus A321s, and newly delivered Boeing 737s, include seatback TVs, featuring AVOD in each seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

American Airlines marketed increased legroom in economy class as &quot;More Room Throughout Coach&quot;, also referred to as &quot;MRTC&quot; starting in February 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/corporateInformation/facts/history.jsp |title=History of American Airlines - About us - American Airlines |website=Aa.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two rows of economy class seats were removed on Boeing 737 and McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday30.usatoday.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/news/2004-10-20-more-seats_x.htm |title=USATODAY.com - American Airlines squeezes passengers in tighter to make money |website=Usatoday30.usatoday.com |date=2004-10-21 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid financial losses, this scheme was discontinued in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday30.usatoday.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.time.com/2012/03/02/american-airlines-offering-more-legroom-for-a-price/|title=American Airlines Offering More Legroom … For a Price|first=Josh|last=Sanburn|publisher=|via=business.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing promotion shortly after he was made an honorary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]. Inspired by the [[Kentucky colonel]]s and other [[Title of honor|honorary]] organizations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers &quot;admirals&quot; of the &quot;Flagship fleet&quot; (AA called its aircraft &quot;Flagships&quot; at the time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Li |first1=Lucy |title=Ultimate Guide to Admirals Club |url=http://www.loungebuddy.com/admirals-club-ultimate-guide/ |website=LoungeBuddy |publisher=LoungeBuddy, Inc |accessdate=20 July 2015 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6aAbZqFo0?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.loungebuddy.com%2Fadmirals-club-ultimate-guide%2F |archivedate=20 July 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of Admirals included many celebrities, politicians, and other VIPs, as well as more &quot;ordinary&quot; customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.

There was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the &quot;Admirals Club&quot; in 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their own liquor at the airport.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination,&lt;ref name=&quot;timeac&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Toward Equality for VIPs|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|work=TIME|date=July 15, 1966|accessdate=January 26, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114112519/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere| archivedate=January 14, 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Club (and most other airline lounges) switched to a paid membership program.

===Flagship Lounge===
Though affiliated with the Admirals Club and staffed by many of the same employees, the Flagship Lounge is a separate lounge specifically designed for customers flying in First Class on transcontinental domestic flights and international flights, as well as AAdvantage Executive Platinum and Oneworld Emerald frequent flyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/airportAmenities/AAFlagshipLounges.jsp |title=Flagship Lounges − Clubs − American Airlines |website=Aa.com |date=2015-09-25 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Flagship Lounges are now available at four airports: Chicago-O'Hare, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles, and New York-JFK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flagship Lounge(R)|url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/airportAmenities/AAFlagshipLounges.jsp|publisher=American Airlines |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; American also previously offered a Flagship Lounge in Miami from 2000 to 2002, and again from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/aa-lounge-opens-at-miami-international |title=AA lounge opens at Miami International |publisher=Business Traveller |date=February 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It plans to open again in 2017.
