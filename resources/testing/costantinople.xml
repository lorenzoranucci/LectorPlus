{{Timeline of Constantinople}}
'''Constantinople''' ({{lang-el|Κωνσταντινούπολις ''Konstantinoúpolis'' or Κωνσταντινούπολη ''Konstantinoúpoli''}}; {{lang-la|Constantinopolis}}; {{lang-ota|قسطنطینية, ''Ḳosṭanṭīnīye''}}) was the [[capital city]] of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]/[[Byzantine Empire]] (330–1204 and 1261–1453), and also of the brief [[Latin Empire|Latin]] (1204–1261), and the later [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] (1453–1923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient [[Byzantium]] as the new capital of the [[Roman Empire]] by Emperor [[Constantine the Great]], after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxf&quot;&gt;&quot;Constantinople&quot; in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium'', [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, 1991, p. 508. ISBN 0-19-504652-8&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-5th century to the early 13th century, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe&lt;ref&gt;Pounds, Norman John Greville. ''An Historical Geography of Europe, 1500–1840'', p. 124. CUP Archive, 1979. ISBN 0-521-22379-2.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was instrumental in the advancement of [[Christianity]] during Roman and Byzantine times as the home of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] and as the guardian of Christendom's holiest relics such as the [[Crown of thorns|Crown of Thorns]] and the [[True Cross]]. After the final loss of its provinces in the early 15th century, the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]] was reduced to just Constantinople and its environs, along with [[Morea]] in Greece, and the city eventually [[fall of Constantinople|fell]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] after a month-long siege in 1453.

[[File:Bizansist touchup.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of Byzantine Constantinople and the Propontis (Sea of Marmara)]]

Constantinople was famed for its massive and complex defences. Although besieged on numerous occasions by various peoples, the defences of Constantinople proved invulnerable for nearly nine hundred years before the city was taken by foreign forces in 1204 by the Crusader armies of the [[Fourth Crusade]], and after it was liberated in 1261 by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], a second and final time in 1453 when it was conquered by the [[Sultan|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]]. The first wall of the city was erected by [[Constantine I]], and surrounded the city on both land and sea fronts. Later, in the 5th century, the [[Praetorian prefect|Praetorian Prefect]] [[Anthemius (praetorian prefect)|Anthemius]] under the child emperor [[Theodosius II]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;undertook the construction of the [[Theodosian Walls]], which consisted of a double wall lying about {{convert|2|km|abbr=in}} to the west of the first wall and a moat with palisades in front.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Byzantine State and Society|last = Treadgold|first = Warren|publisher = Stanford University Press|year = 1997|isbn = |location = Stanford, California|page = 89}}&lt;/ref&gt; This formidable complex of defences was one of the most sophisticated of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]] and the city was built intentionally on seven hills as well as juxtaposed between the [[Golden Horn]] and the [[Sea of Marmara]] and thus presented an impregnable fortress enclosing magnificent palaces, domes, and towers, necessitated from being the gateway between two [[continent]]s (Europe and Asia) and two seas (the Mediterranean and the Black Seas).

The city was also famed for its architectural masterpieces, such as the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] cathedral of [[Hagia Sophia]], which served as the seat of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]], the sacred [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Imperial Palace]] where the Emperors lived, the [[Galata Tower]], the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]], the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]] of the Land Walls, and the opulent aristocratic palaces lining the arcaded avenues and squares. Constantinople had a fifth-century university ([[University of Constantinople]]) which contained numerous artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453,&lt;ref&gt;Janin (1964), ''[[passim]]''&lt;/ref&gt; including its vast [[Imperial Library of Constantinople|Imperial Library]] which contained the remnants of the [[Library of Alexandria|Library at Alexandria]] and had over 100,000 volumes of ancient text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/bellagio/bellag1.html|title=Preserving The Intellectual Heritage--Preface|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantinople never truly recovered from the devastation of the Fourth Crusade and the decades of misrule by the Latins. Although the city partially recovered in the early years after the restoration under the [[Palaiologos]] dynasty, the advent of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and the subsequent loss of the Imperial territories until Constantinople became an enclave inside the fledgling Ottoman Empire rendered the city severely depopulated when it fell to the Ottoman Turks,&lt;ref name=&quot;mw28&quot;&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; whereafter it replaced [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) as the new capital of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Rosenberg, Matt. &quot;Largest cities through history.&quot; About.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==

=== Before Constantinople ===
According to [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', the first known name of a settlement on the site of Constantinople was ''Lygos,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20IV Pliny the Elder, book IV, chapter XI:]

[http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20IV &quot;''On leaving the Dardanelles we come to the Bay of Casthenes, ... and the promontory of the Golden Horn, on which is the town of Byzantium, a free state, formerly called Lygos; it is 711 miles from Durazzo,'' ...&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; a settlement of likely Thracian origin founded between the 13th to 11th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last = Vailhé|first = S.|encyclopedia = Catholic Encyclopedia|title = Constantinople|url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04301a.htm|accessdate = 2007-09-12|year = 1908|publisher = Robert Appleton Company|volume = 4|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, according to the founding myth of the city, was abandoned by the time Greek settlers from the city-state of [[Megara]] founded ''[[Byzantium]]'' ({{lang-el|Βυζάντιον}}, ''Byzántion'') in around 657 BC,&lt;ref name=&quot;roo177&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,600 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features, and Historic Sites|year=2006|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, N.C.|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt; across from the town of [[Chalcedon]] on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus.

The origins of the name of ''[[Byzantium|Byzantion]]'', more commonly known by the later Latin ''Byzantium,'' are not entirely clear, though some suggest it is of Thraco-[[Illyria|Illyrian]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Janin, Raymond (1964). ''Constantinople byzantine''. Paris: Institut Français d'Études Byzantines. p. 10f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Georgacas, Demetrius John (1947). &quot;The Names of Constantinople&quot;. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' (The Johns Hopkins University Press) '''78''': 347–67. doi:10.2307/283503. JSTOR 283503.&lt;/ref&gt; The founding myth of the city has it told that the settlement was named after the leader of the Megarian colonists, Byzas. The later Byzantines of Constantinople themselves would maintain that the city was named in honour of two men, Byzas and Antes, though this was more likely just a play on the word [[Byzantium|Byzantion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Constantinople: Capital of Byzantium|last = Harris|first = Johnathan|publisher = Continuum USA|year = 2007|isbn = |location = New York|page = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was briefly renamed ''Augusta Antonina'' in the early 3rd century by the Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (193-211), having razed the city to the ground in 196 AD for supporting a [[Pescennius Niger|rival contender]] in the [[Year of the Five Emperors|civil war]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and rebuilt, in honour of his son Antoninus, the later Emperor [[Caracalla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IA&quot;&gt;Necdet Sakaoğlu (1993/94a): &quot;İstanbul'un adları&quot; [&quot;The names of Istanbul&quot;].

[[File:Column of Constantine, July 2010.jpg|thumb|The [[Column of Constantine]], built by [[Constantine I]] in 330 AD to commemorate the establishment of Constantinople as the [[New Rome|new capital]] of the [[Roman Empire]]]]
Byzantium took on the name of ''Konstantinoupolis'' (&quot;city of Constantine&quot;, ''Constantinople'') after its re-foundation under Roman emperor [[Constantine I]], who transferred the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Rome]] to Byzantium in 330 AD and designated his new capital officially as ''[[New Rome|Nova Roma]]'' (Νέα Ῥώμη) 'New Rome'. During this time, the city was also called 'Second Rome', 'Eastern Rome', and ''Roma Constantinopolitana.''&lt;ref&gt;Georgacas, Demetrius John (1947). &quot;The Names of Constantinople&quot;. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association''(The Johns Hopkins University Press) '''78''': 347–67. doi:10.2307/283503. JSTOR 283503.http://www.constantinethegreatcoins.com/articles/Georgacas_The_Names_of_Constantinople.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As the city became the sole remaining capital of the Roman Empire after the fall of the West, and its wealth, population, and influence grew, the city also came to have a multitude of nicknames.

As the largest and wealthiest city in Europe during the 4th-13th centuries and a centre of culture and education of the Mediterranean basin, Constantinople came to be known by prestigious titles such as ''Basileuousa'' (Queen of Cities) and ''Megalopolis'' (the Great City) and was, in colloquial speech, commonly referred to as just ''Polis'' (η πόλη) 'the City' by Constantinopolitans and provincial Byzantines alike.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2007, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the language of other peoples, Constantinople was referred to just as reverently. The medieval Vikings, who had contacts with the empire through their expansion in eastern Europe ([[Varangians]]) used the Old Norse name ''Miklagarðr'' (from ''mikill'' 'big' and ''garðr'' 'city'), and later ''Miklagard'' and ''Miklagarth''. In Arabic, the city was sometimes called ''Rūmiyyat al-kubra'' (Great City of the Romans) and in Persian as ''Takht-e Rum'' (Throne of the Romans).

In East and South Slavic languages, including in [[Kievan Rus'|medieval Russia]], Constantinople was referred to as ''[[Tsargrad]]'' (''Царьград'') or ''Carigrad,'' 'City of the Caesar (Emperor)', from the Slavonic words ''tsar'' ('Caesar' or 'King') and ''grad'' ('city'). This was presumably a calque on a Greek phrase such as Βασιλέως Πόλις ''(Vasileos Polis),'' 'the city of the emperor [king]'.

=== Modern names of the city ===
The modern Turkish name for the city, ''[[İstanbul]]'', derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] phrase ''eis tin polin'' ({{lang|el|εἰς τὴν πόλιν}}), meaning &quot;into the city&quot; or &quot;to the city&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|Istanbul}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was used in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] alongside ''Kostantiniyye'', the more formal adaptation of the original ''Constantinople'', during the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century. In 1928, [[Turkish Language Commission|the Turkish alphabet was changed]] from Arabic script to Latin script. After that, as part of the 1920s [[Turkification]] movement, Turkey started to urge other countries to use [[Geographical name changes in Turkey|Turkish names for Turkish cities]], instead of other transliterations to Latin script that had been used in the Ottoman times.&lt;ref name=&quot;shawn&quot;&gt;Stanford and Ezel Shaw (1977): History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Vol II, p. 386; Robinson (1965), The First Turkish Republic, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Burham, ''The Dictionary of Misinformation'', Ballantine, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Room, Adrian, (1993), ''Place Name changes 1900–1991'', Metuchen, N.J., &amp; London:The Scarecrow Press, Inc., ISBN 0-8108-2600-3 pp. 46, 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul].&lt;/ref&gt; In time the city came to be known as Istanbul and its variations in most world languages.

The name &quot;Constantinople&quot; is still used by members of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the title of one of their most important leaders, the Orthodox [[Patriarch of Constantinople|patriarch]] based in the city, referred to as &quot;His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch.&quot; In Greece today, the city is still called Konstantinoúpolis/Konstantinoúpoli (Κωνσταντινούπολη/Κωνσταντινούπολις) or simply just &quot;the City&quot; (Η Πόλη / Η Πόλις).

== History ==

=== c. 657 BC–324 AD: Byzantium and earlier settlements ===
{{Main|Byzantium}}
Constantinople was founded by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine I]] (272–337 AD) in 324&lt;ref name=Oxf /&gt; on the site of an already-existing city, [[Byzantium]], which was settled in the early days of [[Greek colonies|Greek colonial expansion]], in around 657 BC, by colonists of the city-state of [[Megara]]. This is the first major settlement that would develop on the site of later Constantinople, but the first known settlements was that of ''Lygos'', referred to in Pliny's Natural Histories,&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, IV, xi&lt;/ref&gt; which was a village or town of suggested Thracian origin that was believed to have been founded in the 13th to 11th centuries BC. Apart from this, little is known about this initial settlement, except that it was abandoned by the time the Megarian colonists settled the site anew.

The city maintained independence as a city-state until it was annexed by [[Darius I]] in 512 BC into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], who saw the site as the optimal location to construct a [[pontoon bridge]] crossing into Europe as Byzantium was situated at the narrowest point in the Bosphorus strait. Persian rule lasted until 478 BC when as part of the Greek counterattack to the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|Second Persian Invasion of Greece]], a Greek army led by the Spartan general [[Pausanias (general)|Pausanias]] captured the city which remained an independent, yet subordinate, city under the Athenians, and later to the Spartans after 411 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, I, 94&lt;/ref&gt; A farsighted treaty with the emergent power of Rome in c.150 BC which stipulated tribute in exchange for independent status allowed it to enter Roman rule unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2007, pp.24-25&lt;/ref&gt; This treaty would pay dividends retrospectively as Byzantium would maintain this independent status, and prosper under peace and stability in the [[Pax Romana]], for nearly three centuries until the late 2nd century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2007, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Byzantium was never a major influential city-state like that of Athens, Corinth, and Sparta, but the city enjoyed relative peace and steady growth as a prosperous trading city lent by its remarkable position. The site lay astride the land route from [[Europe]] to [[Asia]] and the [[Turkish Straits|seaway]] from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]], and had in the [[Golden Horn]] an excellent and spacious harbour. Already then, in Greek and early Roman times, Byzantium was famous for its strategic geographic position that made it difficult to besiege and capture, and its position at the crossroads of the Asiatic-European trade route over land and as the gateway between the Mediterranean and Black Seas made it too valuable of a settlement to abandon, as Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] later realized when he razed the city to the ground for supporting [[Pescennius Niger]]'s [[Year of the Five Emperors|claimancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2007, pp.44-45&lt;/ref&gt; It was a move greatly criticized by the contemporary consul and historian [[Cassius Dio]] who said that Severus had destroyed ''&quot;a strong Roman outpost and a base of operations against the barbarians from Pontus and Asia&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio, ix, p.195&lt;/ref&gt; He would later rebuild Byzantium towards the end of his reign, in which it would be briefly renamed ''Augusta Antonina'', fortifying it with a new city wall in his name, the Severan Wall.

=== 324–337: Foundation of Constantinople ===
[[File:Constantine I Hagia Sophia.jpg|right|thumb|Emperor [[Constantine I]] presents a representation of the city of Constantinople as tribute to an enthroned Mary and Christ Child in this church mosaic. [[Hagia Sophia]], c. 1000]]
[[File:Constantinopolis coin.jpg|right|thumb|[[Coin]] struck by Constantine I to commemorate the founding of Constantinople]]

Constantine had altogether more colourful plans. Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in course of major governmental reforms as well as of [[Constantine I and Christianity|sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church]], he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the [[Danube]] or the [[Euphrates]] frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.

Constantinople was built over 6 years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.&lt;ref name=Oxf /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commemorative coins that were issued during the 330s already refer to the city as ''Constantinopolis'' (see, e.g., Michael Grant, ''The climax of Rome'' (London 1968), p. 133), or &quot;Constantine's City&quot;. According to the ''Reallexikon für Antike und Christentum'', vol. 164 (Stuttgart 2005), column 442, there is no evidence for the tradition that Constantine officially dubbed the city &quot;New Rome&quot; (''Nova Roma''). It is possible that the Emperor called the city &quot;Second Rome&quot; ({{lang-el|Δευτέρα Ῥώμη}}, ''Deutéra Rhōmē'') by official decree, as reported by the 5th-century church historian [[Socrates of Constantinople]]: See [[Names of Constantinople]].&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;A description can be found in the [[Notitia urbis Constantinopolitanae]].&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, at first, Constantine's new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a [[proconsul]], rather than an [[urban prefect]]. It had no [[praetors]], [[tribunes]], or [[quaestors]]. Although it did have senators, they held the title ''clarus'', not ''[[clarissimus]]'', like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets. The emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in [[Diocese of Asia|Asiana]] and [[Diocese of Pontus|Pontica]] and on 18 May 332 he announced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the citizens. At the time, the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day, doled out from 117 distribution points around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Socrates II.13, cited by J B Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it the [[Augustaion|Augustaeum]]. The new senate-house (or Curia) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the great square was erected the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] of the Emperor with its imposing entrance, the [[Chalke]], and its ceremonial suite known as the [[Daphne Palace|Palace of Daphne]]. Nearby was the vast [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the famed [[Baths of Zeuxippus]]. At the western entrance to the Augustaeum was the [[Milion]], a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the Eastern Roman Empire.

From the Augustaeum led a great street, the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]] (Greek: Μέση [Οδός] lit. &quot;Middle [Street]&quot;), lined with colonnades. As it descended the First Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the [[Praetorium]] or law-court. Then it passed through the oval [[Forum of Constantine]] where there was a second Senate-house and a [[Column of Constantine|high column]] with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of [[Helios]], crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there the Mese passed on and through the [[Forum Tauri]] and then the [[Forum Bovis]], and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the [[Wall of Constantine (Constantinople)|Constantinian Wall]]. After the construction of the [[Theodosian Walls]] in the early 5th century, it was extended to the new [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], reaching a total length of seven [[Roman mile]]s.&lt;ref&gt;J B Bury, History of the Later Roman Empire, p. 75. ''et seqq''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 337–529: Constantinople during the Migration Period ===
[[File:Theodosius colum, Istanbul.jpg|thumb|[[Theodosius I]] was the last [[Roman emperor]] who ruled over an undivided empire (detail from the Obelisk at the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]).]]

The importance of Constantinople increased but it was gradual. From the death of Constantine in 337 to the accession of Theodosius I emperors had been resident only in the years 337-8, 347-51, 58-61, 68-69. It's status as a capital was recognized by the appointment of the first known Urban Prefect of the City Honoratus, who took office on 11 December 359 and until 361. The urban prefects had concurrent jurisdiction over three provinces each in the adjacent dioceses of Thrace (in which the city was located), Pontus and Asia comparable to the 100 mile extraordinary jurisdiction of the prefect of Rome. The emperor [[Valens]] who hated the city and spent only one year there nevertheless built the Palace of [[Hebdomon]] on the shore of the [[Sea of Marmara|Propontis]] near the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] and [[Basiliscus]] were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. [[Theodosius I]] founded the [[Studion|Church of John the Baptist]] to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the [[Topkapı Palace]] in Istanbul, Turkey), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of [[Aphrodite]] into a coach house for the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Praetorian Prefect]]; [[Arcadius]] built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.

After the shock of the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, in which the emperor [[Valens]] with the flower of the Roman armies was destroyed by the [[Visigoths]] within a few days' march, the city looked to its defences, and in 413–414, [[Theodosius II]] built the 18-metre (60-foot)-tall [[Walls of Constantinople|triple-wall fortifications]], which were never to be breached until the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a [[University of Constantinople|University]] near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.

[[Uldin]], a prince of the [[Huns]], appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river. Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city, and the fleet on the Danube improved.

In due course, the [[barbarian]]s overran the Western Roman Empire: Its emperors retreated to [[Ravenna]], and it diminished to nothing. Thereafter, Constantinople became in truth the largest city of the Roman Empire and of the world. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City, and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia flowed into Constantinople.

=== 527–565: Constantinople in the Age of Justinian ===
[[File:Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonte.jpg|right|thumb|Map of Constantinople (1422) by Florentine cartographer [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti]]&lt;ref&gt;''Liber insularum Archipelagi'', [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest surviving map of the city, and the only one that predates the Turkish conquest of the city in 1453]]

The emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public works. It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure, the ship of the commander [[Belisarius]] was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory, in 534, the [[Herod's Temple|Temple treasure of Jerusalem]], looted by the Romans in [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|70 AD]] and taken to [[Carthage]] by the [[Vandals]] after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the [[Church of St. Polyeuctus]], before being returned to [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] in either the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Church of the Resurrection]] or the New Church.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Barker, Times Literary Supplement 4 May 2007, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome) the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.

Throughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the [[Christian orthodoxy|orthodox]] and the [[monophysites]] became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said&lt;ref&gt;Procopius' '' Secret History'': see P Neville-Ure, Justinian and his Age, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; to affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the [[Nika riots|&quot;Nika&quot; riots]] (from the battle-cry of &quot;Victory!&quot; of those involved).

Fires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine's basilica of Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), the city's principal church, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned [[Anthemius of Tralles]] and [[Isidore of Miletus]] to replace it with a new and incomparable [[Hagia Sophia]]. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest of the city, and is now a museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, &quot;O [[Solomon's Temple|Solomon]], I have outdone thee!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Source for quote: ''Scriptores originum Constantinopolitanarum'', ed T Preger I 105 (see [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|A. A. Vasiliev]], ''History of the Byzantine Empire'', 1952, vol I, p. 188).&lt;/ref&gt; Hagia Sophia was served by 600 people including 80 priests, and cost 20,000 pounds of gold to build.&lt;ref name=&quot;cost&quot;&gt;T. Madden, ''Crusades: The Illustrated History'', 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justinian also had Anthemius and Isidore demolish and replace the original Church of the Holy Apostles built by Constantine with a [[Church of the Holy Apostles|new church]] under the same dedication. This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics. This church was to remain the burial place of the Emperors from Constantine himself until the 11th century. When the city fell to the Turks in 1453, the church was demolished to make room for the tomb of [[Mehmet II]] the Conqueror. Justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the city's built environment, legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting building within {{convert|100|ft|m}} of the sea front, in order to protect the view.&lt;ref&gt;Justinian, ''Novellae'' 63 and 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

During Justinian I's reign, the city's population reached about 500,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/handouts/Population.htm Early Medieval and Byzantine Civilization: Constantine to Crusades] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150826083011/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/H303/handouts/Population.htm |date=August 26, 2015 }}, Dr. Kenneth W. Harl.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the social fabric of Constantinople was also damaged by the onset of the [[Plague of Justinian]] between 541–542 AD. It killed perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4381924.stm Past pandemics that ravaged Europe], [[BBC News]], November 7, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survival, 565–717: Constantinople during the Byzantine Dark Ages ===
In the early 7th century, the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and later the [[Bulgars]] overwhelmed much of the [[Balkans]], threatening Constantinople to attack from the west. Simultaneously, the [[Persia]]n [[Sassanid]]s overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into [[Anatolia]]. [[Heraclius]], son to the [[exarch]] of [[Africa]], set sail for the city and assumed the purple. He found the military situation so dire that he is said at first to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay. The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realised that the city no longer could be supplied from Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population dropped substantially in size as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Possibly from the largest city in the world with 500,000 inhabitants to just 40,000–70,000: The Inheritance of Rome, Chris Wickham, Penguin Books Ltd. 2009, ISBN 978-0-670-02098-0 (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the city withstood a [[Siege of Constantinople (626)|siege]] by the Sasanids and Avars in 626, Heraclius campaigned deep into Persian territory and briefly restored the ''status quo'' in 628, when the Persians surrendered all their conquests. However, further sieges followed in the course of attacks from the [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|Arabs]], a [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|first]] from 674 to 678, and a [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|second]] from 717 to 718. At this time the [[Theodosian Walls]] kept the city impregnable from the land, while a newly discovered incendiary substance known as &quot;[[Greek Fire]]&quot; allowed the [[Byzantine navy]] to destroy the Arab fleets and keep the city supplied. In the second siege, the Second ruler of [[Bulgaria]], [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Khan Tervel]] (also called St. Triveliy) rendered decisive help, largely due to him the city was saved; he was called ''Saviour of Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programata.bg/?p=62&amp;c=1&amp;id=51493&amp;l=2|title=Exposition, Dedicated to Khan Tervel|work=Programata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 717–1025: Constantinople during the Macedonian Renaissance ===
[[File:Imperial Gate mosaic in Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|[[Emperor Leo VI]] (886–912) adoring [[Jesus Christ]]. [[Mosaic]] above the Imperial Gate in the [[Hagia Sophia]].]]
In the 730s [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] carried out extensive repairs of the Theodosian walls, which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks; this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 1952, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodora, widow of the Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilus]] (died 842), acted as regent during the minority of her son [[Michael III]], who was said to have been introduced to dissolute habits by her brother Bardas. When Michael assumed power in 856, he became known for excessive drunkenness, appeared in the hippodrome as a charioteer and burlesqued the religious processions of the clergy. He removed Theodora from the Great Palace to the Carian Palace and later to the [[Sancaktar Hayrettin Mosque|monastery of Gastria]], but, after the death of Bardas, she was released to live in the palace of St Mamas; she also had a rural residence at the Anthemian Palace, where Michael was assassinated in 867.&lt;ref&gt;George Finlay, History of the Byzantine Empire, Dent, London, 1906, pp. 156–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 860, an [[Rus'–Byzantine War (860)|attack]] was made on the city by a new principality set up a few years earlier at [[Kiev]] by [[Askold and Dir]], two [[Varangian]] chiefs: Two hundred small vessels passed through the Bosporus and plundered the monasteries and other properties on the suburban [[Prince's Islands]]. [[Niketas Oryphas|Oryphas]], the admiral of the Byzantine fleet, alerted the emperor Michael, who promptly put the invaders to flight; but the suddenness and savagery of the onslaught made a deep impression on the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, 1906, pp. 174–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 980, the emperor [[Basil II]] received an unusual gift from Prince [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]] of Kiev: 6,000 [[Varangian]] warriors, which Basil formed into a new bodyguard known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. They were known for their ferocity, honour, and loyalty. It is said that, in 1038, they were dispersed in winter quarters in the [[Thracesian Theme|Thracesian theme]] when one of their number attempted to violate a countrywoman, but in the struggle she seized his sword and killed him; instead of taking revenge, however, his comrades applauded her conduct, compensated her with all his possessions, and exposed his body without burial as if he had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, 1906, p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; However, following the death of an Emperor, they became known also for plunder in the Imperial palaces.&lt;ref&gt;Enoksen, Lars Magnar. (1998). ''Runor : historia, tydning, tolkning''. Historiska Media, Falun. ISBN 91-88930-32-7 p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 11th Century the Varangian Guard became dominated by [[Anglo-Saxons]] who preferred this way of life to subjugation by the [[Norman conquest of England|new Norman kings of England]].&lt;ref&gt;J M Hussey, The Byzantine World, Hutchinson, London, 1967, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Book of the Eparch]]'', which dates to the 10th century, gives a detailed picture of the city's commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated such matters as production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one. It is an impressive testament to the strength of tradition how little these arrangements had changed since the office, then known by the Latin version of its title, had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 1952, pp. 343–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th and 10th centuries, Constantinople had a population of between 500,000 and 800,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/cities/turkey/istanbul/istanbul.html Silk Road Seattle – Constantinople], Daniel C. Waugh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Iconoclast Controversy in Constantinople ====
In the 8th and 9th centuries, the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclast]] movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire. The emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction of a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The officer given the task was killed by the crowd, and in the end the image was removed rather than destroyed: It was to be restored by [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] and removed again by [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]]: Finlay 1906, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constantine V]] convoked a [[Council of Hieria|church council in 754]], which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|church of the Holy Virgin]] at [[Blachernae]] as having been transformed into a &quot;fruit store and aviary&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 1952, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of her son [[Leo IV the Khazar|Leo IV]] in 780, the empress [[Irene (empress)|Irene]] restored the veneration of images through the agency of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.

The iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress [[Theodora (9th century)|Theodora]], who restored the icons. These controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the [[Catholicism|Western]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] Churches.

=== 1025–1081: Constantinople after Basil II ===
In the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in Armenia in 1071. The Emperor [[Romanos IV|Romanus]] Diogenes was captured. The peace terms demanded by [[Alp Arslan]], sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, [[Michael VII]] Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire's resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople.

=== 1081–1185: Constantinople under the Comneni ===
[[File:Byzantium@1180.jpg|thumb|The [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]], c. 1180]]
[[File:Istanbul 2009 Comnenus Mosaics.JPG|thumb|12th century [[mosaic]] from the upper gallery of the [[Hagia Sophia]], Constantinople.

Under the Comnenian dynasty (1081–1185), Byzantium staged a remarkable recovery. In 1090–91, the nomadic [[Pechenegs]] reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the [[Kipchaks]] annihilated their army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Pechenegs |title=The Pechenegs |accessdate=2009-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829210704/http://www.geocities.com/egfroth1/Pechenegs |archivedate=2005-08-29 |df= }}, Steven Lowe and Dmitriy V. Ryaboy.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to a call for aid from [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius]], the [[First Crusade]] assembled at Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command set out for [[Jerusalem]] on its own account.&lt;ref&gt;There is an excellent source for these events: the writer and historian [[Anna Komnene|Anna Comnena]] in her work [[The Alexiad]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[John II Komnenos|John II]] built the monastery of the Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds.&lt;ref&gt;Vasiliev 1952, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the restoration of firm central government, the empire became fabulously wealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the [[Venice|Venetians]] and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of [[Outremer]] and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and [[Egypt]]. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of [[Manuel I Komnenos]]'s reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000–80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;popu&quot;&gt;J. Phillips, ''The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jews&quot;&gt;J.

In artistic terms, the 12th century was a very productive period. There was a revival in the [[mosaic]] art, for example: Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H. Baynes (''Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization''):

: &quot;With its love of luxury and passion for colour, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the whole of the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the workshops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals – lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins – confronting each other, or represented Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase.&quot;

: &quot;From the tenth to the twelfth century Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark's at Venice and of the cathedral at [[Torcello]] clearly reveal their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the [[Cappella Palatina|Palatine Chapel]], the [[Martorana]] at [[Palermo]], and the [[cathedral of Cefalù]], together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, demonstrate the influence of Byzantium on the [[italo-Normans|Norman]] Court of [[Sicily]] in the twelfth century. Hispano-[[Moorish]] art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. [[Romanesque art]] owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of [[Kiev]], [[doge of Venice|Venetian doges]], abbots of [[Monte Cassino]], merchants of [[Amalfi]], and the kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the twelfth century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production.&quot;

[[File:Byzantium1204.png|thumb|The [[Latin Empire]], [[Empire of Nicaea]], [[Empire of Trebizond]], and the [[Despotate of Epirus]]. The borders are very uncertain]]
On 25 July 1197, Constantinople was struck by a [[Constantine stilbes#Works|severe fire]] which burned the Latin Quarter and the area around the Gate of the Droungarios ({{lang-tr|Odun Kapısı}}) on the Golden Horn.&lt;ref name=&quot;stilbes&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Stilbes|first=Constantine |author2=Johannes M.

In the course of a plot between [[Philip of Swabia]], [[Boniface of Montferrat]] and the [[Enrico Dandolo|Doge of Venice]], the [[Fourth Crusade]] was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexius, son of the deposed emperor Isaac. The reigning emperor Alexius III had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied [[Galata]], broke the [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] protecting the [[Golden Horn]] and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But the new [[Alexius IV]] found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased. In January 1204, the ''[[protovestiarius]]'' Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of [[Phidias]], which stood in the principal forum facing west.

In February, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as [[Alexius V]]. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in Hagia Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the [[Milion|Golden Milestone]] before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.

[[Sir Steven Runciman]], historian of the Crusades, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is “unparalleled in history”.

{{quote|“For nine centuries,” he goes on, “the great city had been the capital of Christian civilisation. It was filled with works of art that had survived from ancient Greece and with the masterpieces of its own exquisite craftsmen. The Venetians ... seized treasures and carried them off to adorn ... their town. But the Frenchmen and Flemings were filled with a lust for destruction. They rushed in a howling mob down the streets and through the houses, snatching up everything that glittered and destroying whatever they could not carry, pausing only to murder or to rape, or to break open the wine-cellars ... . Neither monasteries nor churches nor libraries were spared. In Hagia Sophia itself, drunken soldiers could be seen tearing down the silken hangings and pulling the great silver [[iconostasis]] to pieces, while sacred books and icons were trampled under foot. While they drank merrily from the altar-vessels a prostitute set herself on the Patriarch’s throne and began to sing a ribald French song. Nuns were ravished in their convents. Palaces and hovels alike were entered and wrecked. Wounded women and children lay dying in the streets. For three days the ghastly scenes ... continued, till the huge and beautiful city was a shambles. ... When ... order was restored, ... citizens were tortured to make them reveal the goods that they had contrived to hide.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''A History of the Crusades'', Cambridge 1966 [1954], vol 3, p.123.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the [[Latin Empire]]. Under the rulers of the Latin Empire, the city declined, both in population and the condition of its buildings. Alice-Mary Talbot cites an estimated population for Constantinople of 400,000 inhabitants; after the destruction wrought by the Crusaders on the city, about one third were homeless, and numerous courtiers, nobility, and higher clergy, followed various leading personages into exile. &quot;As a result Constantinople became seriously depopulated,&quot; Talbot concludes.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1291680 &quot;The Restoration of Constantinople under Michael VIII&quot;], ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', '''47''' (1993), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latins took over at least 20 churches and 13 monasteries, most prominently the Hagia Sophia, which became the cathedral of the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. It is to these that E.H. Swift attributed the construction of a series of flying buttresses to shore up the walls of the church, which had been weakened over the centuries by earthquake tremors.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, &quot;Restoration of Constantinople&quot;, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; However, this act of maintenance is an exception: for the most part, the Latin occupiers were too few to maintain all of the buildings, either secular and sacred, and many became targets for vandalism or dismantling. Bronze and lead were removed from the roofs of abandoned buildings and melted down and sold to provide money to the chronically under-funded Empire for defense and to support the court; Deno John Geanokoplos writes that &quot;it may well be that a division is suggested here: Latin laymen stripped secular buildings, ecclesiastics, the churches.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael Palaeologus and the West'' (Harvard University Press, 1959), p. 124 n. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings were not the only targets of officials looking to raise funds for the impoverished Latin Empire: the monumental sculptures which adorned the Hippodrome and fora of the city were pulled down and melted for coinage. &quot;Among the masterpieces destroyed, writes Talbot, &quot;were a Herakles attributed to the fourth-century B.C. sculptor [[Lysippos]], and monumental figures of Hera, Paris, and Helen.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Talbot-248&quot;&gt;Talbot, &quot;Restoration of Constantinople&quot;, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nicaean emperor [[John III Vatatzes]] reportedly saved several churches from being dismantled for their valuable building materials; by sending money to the Latins &quot;to buy them off&quot; (''exonesamenos''), he prevented the destruction of several churches.&lt;ref&gt;Geanakoplos, ''Emperor Michael'', p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; According to Talbot, these included the churches of Blachernae, Rouphinianai, and St. Michael at Anaplous. He also granted funds for the restoration of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], which had been seriously damaged in an earthquake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Talbot-248&quot; /&gt;

The Byzantine nobility scattered, many going to [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], where Theodore Lascaris set up an imperial court, or to [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]], where Theodore Angelus did the same; others fled to [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]], where one of the Comneni had already with Georgian support established an independent seat of empire.&lt;ref&gt;Hussey 1967, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Nicaea and Epirus both vied for the imperial title, and tried to recover Constantinople. In 1261, Constantinople was [[Reconquest of Constantinople|captured]] from its last Latin ruler, [[Baldwin II of Constantinople|Baldwin II]], by the forces of the [[Nicaean Empire|Nicaean emperor]] [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]].

Although Constantinople was retaken by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive. The [[palace of Blachernae]] in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the [[Bosporus]] going into decline. When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;popu2&quot;&gt;T.

Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Empire on 29 May 1453. The Ottomans were commanded by 22-year-old Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. The conquest of Constantinople followed a seven-week siege that had begun on 6 April 1453.

=== 1453–1922: Ottoman Kostantiniyye ===
{{Main|Constantinople during the Ottoman era}}

The Christian Orthodox city of Constantinople was now under Ottoman control. When [[Mehmed II]] finally entered Constantinople through what is now known as the [[Topkapi Palace|Topkapi Gate]], he immediately rode his horse to the [[Hagia Sophia]], where he ordered his soldiers to stop hacking at the marbles and 'be satisfied with the booty and captives; as for all the buildings, they belonged to him'.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Mansel, Philip. Constantinople: City of the World's Desire. Penguin History Travel, ISBN 0-14-026246-6. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered that an [[imam]] meet him there in order to chant the [[adhan]] thus transforming the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] cathedral into a Muslim [[mosque]],&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. Istanbul and the Civilization if the Ottoman Empire. 1, University of Oklahoma Press, 1963. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; solidifying [[Islam]]ic rule in Constantinople.

Mehmed’s main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the city’s defenses and population. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inalcik, Halil 1969, p. 236&quot;&gt;Inalcik, Halil. “The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.” Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229–249. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.&lt;ref name=&quot;Inalcik, Halil 1969, p. 236&quot; /&gt; From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city: these people were called &quot;Sürgün&quot; in Turkish ({{lang-gr|σουργουνιδες}}).&lt;ref name=mw28 /&gt; Two centuries later, Ottoman traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of [[Istanbul]], such as [[Aksaray, Istanbul|Aksaray]], [[Çarşamba, Istanbul|Çarşamba]], bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants.&lt;ref name=mw28 /&gt; However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city.&lt;ref name=mw28 /&gt;

=== Culture ===
Constantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular, [[Hagia Sophia]], or the Church of Holy Wisdom: A Russian 14th-century traveler, Stephen of Novgorod, wrote, &quot;As for Hagia Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.&quot;

It was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city's fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world. The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable. In terms of technology, art and culture, as well as sheer size, Constantinople was without parallel anywhere in Europe for a thousand years.

[[Armenians]], [[Syrians]], [[Slavs]] and [[Georgians]] were part of the Byzantine social hierarchy.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1996|pp=29}}

=== International status ===
[[File:Constantinople imperial district.png|right|thumb|Constantinople's monumental center.]]

The city provided a defence for the eastern provinces of the old Roman Empire against the barbarian invasions of the 5th century. The 18-meter-tall walls built by [[Theodosius II]] were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the [[Danube river]], who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia. From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the [[Anastasian Wall]], a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the [[Thrace|Thracian]] [[peninsula]]. Many scholars{{Who|date=January 2010}} argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Western Roman Empire|the west]] collapsed. With the emergence of [[Christianity]] and the rise of [[Islam]], Constantinople became the last bastion of Christian Europe, standing at the fore of Islamic expansion, and repelling its influence. As the Byzantine Empire was situated in-between the Islamic world and the Christian west, so did Constantinople act as Europe’s first line-of-defence against Arab advances in the 7th and 8th centuries. The city, and the Empire, would ultimately fall to the [[Ottomans]] by 1453, but its enduring legacy had provided Europe centuries of resurgence following the collapse of Rome.

Constantinople's fame was such that [[Sino-Roman relations|it was described]] even in contemporary [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese histories]], the ''[[Old Book of Tang|Old]]'' and ''[[New Book of Tang]]'', which mentioned its massive walls and gates as well as a purported [[Water clock|clepsydra]] mounted with a golden statue of a man.&lt;ref&gt;Ball (2016), pp 152–153; see also endnote #114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hirth 2000&quot;&gt;Hirth (2000) [1885], [http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/eastasia/romchin1.asp East Asian History Sourcebook]. Retrieved 24 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), 46-48; see also footnote #1 on p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese histories even related how the city [[Siege of Constantinople (674-678)|had been besieged]] in the 7th century by [[Muawiyah I]] and how he exacted [[tribute]] in a peace settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;hirth 2000&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yule (1915), 46-49; see footnote #1 on p. 49 for discussion about the Byzantine diplomat sent to [[Damascus]] who was named in Chinese sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Byzantine architecture}}
[[File:Ayasofya-Innenansicht.jpg|right|thumb|Interior view of the [[Hagia Sophia]], currently a museum.]]

The Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, the basilicas of [[Ravenna]], and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th-century Italian [[Italian coin florin|florin]], the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] of [[Diocletian]] becoming the [[bezant]] prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its [[Theodosian Walls|city walls]] were much imitated (for example, see [[Caernarfon Castle]]) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used.

=== Religion ===
Constantine's foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch]], and made it a prime center of Christianity alongside Rome. This contributed to cultural and theological differences between Eastern and Western Christianity eventually leading to the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]] that divided [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Catholicism]] from [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to [[Islam]], as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the [[Islamic eschatology|End time in Islam]].
