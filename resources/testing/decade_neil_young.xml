'''''Decade''''' is a [[compilation album|compilation]] by [[Neil Young]], originally released in 1977 as a [[triple album]], now available on two [[compact discs]]. It contains 35 of Young's songs recorded between 1966 and 1976, among them five tracks that had been unreleased up to that point. It peaked at No. 43 on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Top Pop Albums chart, and was certified [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?artist=%22Young,%20Neil%22|title=Searchable Database|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|accessdate=2014-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Compiled by Young himself, with his hand-written [[liner notes]] about each track, ''Decade'' represents almost every album from his career and various affiliations through 1977 with the exception of ''[[Four Way Street]]'' and ''[[Time Fades Away]]''. Of the previously unreleased songs, &quot;Down to the Wire&quot; features the [[New Orleans]] pianist [[Dr. John]] with [[Buffalo Springfield]] on an item from their shelved ''Stampede'' album; &quot;[[Love Is a Rose]]&quot; was a minor hit for [[Linda Ronstadt]] in 1975; &quot;Winterlong&quot; received a cover by [[Pixies]] on the Neil Young tribute album from 1989, ''[[The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young|The Bridge]]''; and &quot;Campaigner&quot; is a Young song critical of [[Richard Nixon]].  The track &quot;Long May You Run&quot; is a different mix to that found on the [[Long May You Run|album of the same name]], featuring the harmonies of the full [[Crosby Stills &amp; Nash]] before [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] left the recording sessions.

For many years, ''Decade'' was the only Neil Young compilation album available. A 1993 compilation called ''[[Lucky Thirteen (Neil Young album)|Lucky Thirteen]]'' was released, but it only covered Young's 1982–1988 output. It was not until 2004 that [[Reprise Records]] released a single-disc retrospective of his best-known tracks, titled ''[[Greatest Hits (Neil Young album)|Greatest Hits]]''. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, Young promised fans a follow-up to the original ''Decade'' collection, provisionally titled ''Decade II''; eventually, this idea was scrapped in favor of a much more comprehensive anthology to be titled ''[[Neil Young Archives|Archives]]'', spanning his entire career and ranging in size from a box set to an entire series of audio and/or video releases. The first release of archival material since ''Decade'' and ''Lucky Thirteen'' would appear in 2006, ''[[Live at the Fillmore East (Neil Young album)|Live at the Fillmore East]]'', a recording from a 1970 concert featuring [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]] with [[Danny Whitten]]. Several other archival live releases followed, and in 2009 the first of several planned multi-disc box sets, ''[[The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972]]'', was issued.

==Alternate early version==
Initially, ''Decade'' was to be released in 1976, but was pulled at the last minute by Young.  It was shelved until the following year, where it appeared with two songs removed from the original track list (a live version of &quot;[[Don't Cry No Tears]]&quot; recorded in Japan in 1976, and a live version of &quot;Pushed It Over the End&quot; recorded in 1974). Also removed were the following comments on those two songs and ''[[Time Fades Away]]'', from Young's handwritten liner notes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Paul |title= Neil Young: Love to Burn |isbn=0-934558-19-1 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Time Fades Away. No songs from this album are included here. It was recorded on my biggest tour ever, 65 shows in 90 days. Money hassles among everyone concerned ruined this tour and record for me but I released it anyway so you folks could see what could happen if you lose it for a while.  I was becoming more interested in an audio verite approach than satistfying {{sic}} the public demands for a repetition of [[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]].&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't Cry No Tears. Initially titled 'I Wonder,' this song was written in 1964.  One of my first songs.  This is a live recording from Japan with Crazy Horse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pushed It over the End. Recorded live on the road in Chicago, 1974.  Thanks to [[David Crosby|Crosby]] &amp; [[Graham Nash|Nash]]'s help on the overdubbed chorus, I was able to complete this work.  I wrote it for [[Patty Hearst]] and her countless brothers and sisters.  Also, I wrote it for myself and the increasing distance between me and you.}}

The album has been lauded in many quarters as one of the best examples of a career retrospective for a [[rock and roll|rock]] artist, and as a template for the [[box set]] collections that would follow in the 1980s and beyond. However, in the original article on Young from the first edition of the ''[[Rolling Stone]] Illustrated History of Rock and Roll'' and a subsequent article in the ''1983 [[Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'', critic [[Dave Marsh]] used this album to accuse Young of deliberately manufacturing a self-mythology, arguing that while his highlights could be seen to place him on a level with other artists from his generation like [[Bob Dylan]] or [[The Beatles]], the particulars of his catalogue did not bear this out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thrasherswheat.org/tfa/marshbookchapter.htm Marsh RSIHRR article at Thrashers Wheat]&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine has since excised the article from subsequent editions of the ''Illustrated History'' book.
