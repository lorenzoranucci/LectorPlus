'''Alan Mathison Turing''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|OBE|FRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tj|ʊər|ɪ|ŋ}}; 23 June 1912&amp;nbsp;– 7 June 1954) was an English [[computer scientist]], [[mathematician]], [[logic]]ian, [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] and [[mathematical and theoretical biology|theoretical biologist]].  He was highly influential in the development of [[theoretical computer science]], providing a formalisation of the concepts of [[algorithm]] and [[computation]] with the [[Turing machine]], which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Turing worked for the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's [[cryptanalysis|codebreaking]] centre. For a time he led [[Hut 8]], the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German [[cipher]]s, including improvements to the pre-war Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|bombe]] method, an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] machine that could find settings for the [[Enigma machine]]. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]; it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite news | last=Copeland | first=Jack | authorlink=Jack Copeland | title= Alan Turing: The codebreaker who saved 'millions of lives' | date=18 June 2012 | url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18419691 | publisher=BBC News Technology | accessdate= 26 October 2014}} A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both [[The Churchill Centre]] and Turing's biographer [[Andrew Hodges]] have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it, and the Churchill Centre lists it among their Churchill 'Myths', see {{cite web | url=http://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/myths/churchill-said-turing-made-the-single-biggest-contribution-to-allied-victory | title=Churchill Said Turing Made the Single Biggest Contribution to Allied Victory | first=Jonathan | last=Schilling | publisher=The Churchill Centre: Myths | accessdate=9 January 2015}} and {{cite web | url=http://www.turing.org.uk/book/update/part4.html | title=Part 4: The Relay Race | first=Andrew | last=Hodges | publisher=Update to ''Alan Turing: the Enigma'' | accessdate=9 January 2015}}  A BBC News profile piece that repeated the Churchill claim has subsequently been amended to say there is no evidence for it.  See {{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8250592.stm | title=Profile: Alan Turing | first=Clare | last=Spencer | publisher=BBC News | date=11 September 2009 | quote=Update 13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he worked at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]], where he designed the [[Automatic Computing Engine|ACE]], among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined [[Max Newman]]'s [[Computing Machine Laboratory]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], where he helped develop the [[Manchester computers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became interested in [[mathematical biology]]. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of [[morphogenesis]], and predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s such as the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]], first observed in the 1960s.

Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when by the [[Labouchere Amendment]], &quot;gross indecency&quot; was still criminal in the UK. He accepted [[chemical castration]] treatment, with [[Diethylstilbestrol|DES]], as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from [[cyanide poisoning]]. An inquest determined his death as [[suicide]], but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pease |first=Roland |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 |publisher=BBC News  |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2013|title=Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, following an [[Internet activism|Internet campaign]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] made an [[#Government apology and pardon support|official public apology]] on behalf of the British government for &quot;the appalling way he was treated.&quot; [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] granted him a posthumous pardon in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-pardon24Dec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=turingpardon24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/10536246/Alan-Turing-granted-Royal-pardon-by-the-Queen.html|title=Alan Turing granted Royal pardon by the Queen|last=Swinford|first=Steven|date=23 December 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turingindependent24dec2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-turing-gets-his-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html|title=Alan Turing gets his royal pardon for 'gross indecency'&amp;nbsp;– 61 years after he poisoned himself|work=The Independent|date=23 December 2013|author= Wright, Oliver|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Turing was born in [[Maida Vale]], [[London]], while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) at [[Chhatrapur]], [[Bihar and Orissa Province]], in [[British India]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Hodges1983P5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/early.html |title=The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook |publisher=Alan Turing: The Enigma |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev.&amp;nbsp;John Robert Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the [[Netherlands]] and included a [[baronet]]. Turing's mother, Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara (née Stoney; 1881–1976), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway|Madras Railways]]. The Stoneys were a [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] [[Anglo-Irish]] [[gentry]] family from both [[County Tipperary]] and [[County Longford]], while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in [[County Clare]].&lt;ref&gt;Phil Maguire, &quot;An Irishman's Diary&quot;, page 5. ''[[The Irish Times]]'', 23 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the [[Bengal Army]]. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so they moved to [[Maida Vale]],&lt;ref name=&quot;englishheritaget&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001002006005/chooseLetter/T |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jkyjSdgY?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.english-heritage.org.uk%2Fserver%2Fshow%2Fnav.001002006005%2FchooseLetter%2FT |archivedate=13 September 2009 |title=London Blue Plaques |accessdate=10 February 2007 |work=English Heritage |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a [[blue plaque]] on the outside of the house of his birth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/london/2011/03/16/the-scientific-tourist-in-london-17-alan-turings-birth-place The Scientific Tourist In London: #17 Alan Turing's Birth Place], Nature.com London Blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|381}}&lt;/ref&gt; later the [[Colonnade Hotel (London)|Colonnade Hotel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges1983P5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;turingorguk&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/memorial.html | title=The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook | accessdate=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the [[Turing baronets]]).

Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during Turing's childhood years Turing's parents travelled between [[Hastings]] in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired [[British Army|Army]] couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], now marked with a blue plaque.

Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.&lt;ref name=toolbox&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Turing&amp;nbsp;– Towards a Digital Mind: Part 1 |first=G. James |last=Jones |date=11 December 2001 |url=http://www.systemtoolbox.com/article.php?history_id=3 |accessdate=27 July 2007 |work=System Toolbox| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070803163318/http://www.systemtoolbox.com/article.php?history_id=3| archivedate= 3 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents purchased a house in [[Guildford]] in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guildford-dragon.com/2012/11/29/founder-of-computer-science-alan-turings-guildford-stargazing/ |title=Guildford Dragon NEWS |publisher=The Guildford Dragon |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==

===School===
Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to [[Sherborne School]], an independent school in the [[market town]] of [[Sherborne]] in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]] in Britain, but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied {{convert|60|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.&lt;ref name=metamagical&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o8jzWF7rD6oC&amp;pg=PA484  484]|first=Douglas R. |last=Hofstadter |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 |oclc=230812136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the [[classics]]. His headmaster wrote to his parents: &quot;I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming ''educated''. If he is to be solely a ''Scientific Specialist'', he is wasting his time at a public school&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary [[calculus]]. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christopher Morcom===
At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's &quot;first love&quot;. Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from complications of [[bovine tuberculosis]], contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.&lt;ref name=NYReviewBooks&gt;{{cite web|author=Caryl, Christian|title=Poor Imitation of Alan Turing|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/dec/19/poor-imitation-alan-turing/|newspaper=[[New York Review of Books]]|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Hassall, [http://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Sherborne-Formula-Vivat-2012-2013-optimised.pdf 'The Sherborne Formula: The Making of Alan Turing'] 'Vivat!' 2012/13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teuscher&gt;{{Cite book|last=Teuscher |first=Christof (ed.) |authorlink=Christof Teuscher |title=Alan Turing: Life and Legacy of a Great Thinker |year=2004 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=3-540-20020-7 |oclc=53434737 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:&lt;blockquote&gt;I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about me&amp;nbsp;... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because that is what he would like me to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's [[atheism]] and [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gray, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html Alan Turing] Time Magazine's Most Important People of the Century, p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the same kind of body&amp;nbsp;... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or later, perhaps immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===University and work on computability===
After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at [[King's College, Cambridge]], whence he gained first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a [[fellow]] of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the [[central limit theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;See Section 3 of John Aldrich, &quot;England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years&quot;, Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique, vol. 5/2 [http://www.jehps.net/decembre2009.html Decembre 2009] Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to the committee, the theorem had already been proven, in 1922, by [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=88,94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Turing published his paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the ''Entscheidungsproblem''&quot; (1936).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this paper, Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1928. Turing proved that his &quot;universal computing machine&quot; would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''decision problem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt.

[[File:20130808 Kings College Front Court Fountain Crop 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[King's College, Cambridge]], where Turing was a student in 1931 and became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.]]
Although Turing's proof was published shortly after [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Church|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; using his [[lambda calculus]], Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grime|first1=James|title=What Did Turing Do for Us?|url=https://nrich.maths.org/8050|website=[[NRICH]]|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]|accessdate=28 February 2016|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the [[Church–Turing thesis]], Turing machines and the lambda calculus are capable of computing anything that is computable. [[John von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;von Neumann&amp;nbsp;... firmly emphasised to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.&quot; Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Turing machines are a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].

From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at [[Princeton University]]. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from Princeton;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[John von Neumann]] wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went back to England.&lt;ref&gt;''John Von Neumann: The Scientific Genius Who Pioneered the Modern Computer, Game Theory, Nuclear Deterrence, and Much More'', Norman MacRae, 1999, American Mathematical Society, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] about the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cora Diamond]] (ed.), ''Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics'', University of Chicago Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]] and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cryptanalysis==
During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker [[Asa Briggs]] has said, &quot;You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media | last = Briggs | first = Asa | author-link = Asa Briggs, Baron Briggs | title = Britain's Greatest Codebreaker | type=TV broadcast | publisher = [[Channel 4|UK Channel 4]] | date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the [[Government Code and Cypher School#Government Communications Headquarters|GC&amp;CS]], the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]] with [[Dilly Knox]], a senior GC&amp;CS codebreaker.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Copeland|Copeland, Jack]], &quot;Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age&quot;, p. 352 in ''Action This Day'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the July 1939 [[Warsaw]] meeting at which the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of [[Enigma rotor details|Enigma rotors]] and their method of decrypting [[Enigma code]] messages, Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004a|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish method relied on an insecure [[Cryptanalysis#Indicator|indicator]] procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Crib-based decryption|crib-based decryption]] for which he produced the functional specification of the [[bombe]] (an improvement of the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark |first=Liat |url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all |title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Turing flat.jpg|thumb|right|Two cottages in the stable yard at [[Bletchley Park]]. Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940, before moving to [[Hut 8]].]]
On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&amp;CS.&lt;ref name=Copeland2006p378&gt;Copeland, 2006 p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed ''[[Banburismus]]''; developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] (''Tunny'') dubbed ''[[Turingery]]'' and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable [[secure voice]] scrambler at [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre|Hanslope Park]] that was codenamed ''Delilah''.

By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled ''The Applications of Probability to Cryptography''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Turing | first = Alan | year = c. 1941 | title = The Applications of Probability to Cryptography | id = The National Archives (United Kingdom): HW 25/37| url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11510465 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Paper on Statistics of Repetitions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Turing | first = Alan | year = c. 1941 | title = Paper on Statistics of Repetitions | id = The National Archives (United Kingdom): HW 25/38 |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C11510466 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were of such value to GC&amp;CS and its successor [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] that they were not released to the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK National Archives]] until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, &quot;who identified himself only as Richard,&quot; said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance, and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis:&lt;ref name=bbcrichard&gt;{{cite news |last=Vallance |first=Chris |title=Alan Turing papers on code breaking released by GCHQ |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17771962|accessdate=20 April 2012 |newspaper=BBC News |date=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|text=[He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted &quot;shows what a tremendous importance it has in the foundations of our subject&quot;. &amp;hellip; The papers detailed using &quot;mathematical analysis to try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as possible.&quot; &amp;hellip; Richard said that GCHQ had now &quot;squeezed the juice&quot; out of the two papers and was &quot;happy for them to be released into the public domain&quot;.}}

Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as 'Prof' and his treatise on Enigma was known as 'The Prof's Book'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[I.J. Good|Jack Good]], a cryptanalyst who worked with him, is quoted by [[Ronald Lewin]] as having said of Turing:

{{quote|In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|1978|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the {{convert|40|mi}} to London when he was needed for high-level meetings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Brown | first = Anthony Cave | author-link = Anthony Cave Brown | title = Bodyguard of Lies: The Extraordinary True Story Behind D-Day | publisher=The Lyons Press | year = 1975 | isbn = 978-1-59921-383-5 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was capable of world-class marathon standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/10/alan-turing-2012-olympics|title=An Olympic honour for Alan Turing|author=Graham-Cumming, John|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Pat |last=Butcher | url=http://www.globerunner.org/index.php/09/in-praise-of-great-men/ | title=In Praise of Great Men | publisher=Globe Runner | date=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, hampered by an injury.

In 1945, Turing was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] by King [[George VI]] for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Alan Turing: Colleagues share their memories | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18541715 | date = 23 June 2012 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bombe===
Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,&lt;ref name=Copeland2006p378 /&gt; Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish ''[[bomba (cryptography)|bomba kryptologiczna]]'', from which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.

Jack Good opined:

{{quote|Turing's most important contribution, I ''think'', was of part of the design of the bombe, the cryptanalytic machine. He had the idea that you could use, in effect, a theorem in logic which sounds, to the untrained ear, rather absurd; namely that, from a contradiction, you can deduce ''everything.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155383/episodes|title=Heroes of World War II (TV Series 2004– )|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumbnail|left|A complete and working replica of a [[bombe]] at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park]]The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings), using a suitable ''[[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]'': a fragment of probable [[plaintext]]. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; states, or 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jack Good in &quot;The Men Who Cracked Enigma&quot;, 2003: with his caveat: &quot;if my memory is correct&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented [[Electromechanics|electromechanically]].

The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter - this simply wasn't possible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oakley|2006|p=40/03B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] were frustrated. Building on the [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|work of the Poles]], they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals, but they only had a few people and a few bombes, so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer, they had had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month, but they were still on a knife-edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but they were getting nowhere. Finally, breaking all the rules, on 28 October they wrote directly to [[Winston Churchill]] spelling out their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Andrew Hodges]], biographer of Turing, later wrote, &quot;This letter had an electric effect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges 1983 221&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill wrote a memo to [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]], which read: &quot;ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.&quot; On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges 1983 221&quot;/&gt; The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry later recalled, &quot;All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, ''The Essential Turing'', [http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/turingletter.pdf pp. 336–337].&lt;/ref&gt; More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.&lt;ref name=codebreaker&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Jack | last2 = Proudfoot | first2 = Diane | authorlink = Jack Copeland | title = Alan Turing, Codebreaker and Computer Pioneer | url = http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/codebreaker.html | publisher = alanturing.net |date=May 2004 | accessdate =27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hut 8 and the naval Enigma===
Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German naval Enigma|German naval Enigma]] &quot;because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself&quot;.&lt;ref name=MahonP14&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.&lt;ref name=MahonP14 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same night, he also conceived of the idea of ''[[Banburismus]]'', a sequential statistical technique (what [[Abraham Wald]] later called [[sequential analysis]]) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, &quot;though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually broken.&quot;&lt;ref name=MahonP14 /&gt; For this, he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ''[[Ban (unit)|ban]]''. ''Banburismus'' could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.

In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague [[Joan Clarke]], a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly &quot;unfazed&quot; by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=176–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=242–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington; he also visited their [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory|Computing Machine Laboratory]] in Dayton, Ohio.

Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:
{{quote|text=The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use them in that way.

Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

During this trip, he also assisted at [[Bell Labs]] with the development of [[secure speech]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=245–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, [[Colonel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been ''de facto'' head for some time (Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing then became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.

Alexander wrote this about Turing's contribution:
{{quote|There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|circa 1945|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Turingery===
In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed ''[[Turingery]]'' (or jokingly ''Turingismus'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use against the [[Lorenz cipher]] messages produced by the Germans' new ''Geheimschreiber'' (secret writer) machine. This was a [[teleprinter]] [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher attachment]] codenamed ''Tunny'' at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of ''wheel-breaking'', i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced the Tunny team to [[Tommy Flowers]] who, under the guidance of [[Max Newman]], went on to build the [[Colossus computer]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about [[cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gannon|2007|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hilton|2006|pp=197–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=382, 383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delilah===
Following his work at Bell Labs in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=245–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system, and in the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service (later [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre|HMGCC]]) at [[Hanslope Park]]. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable [[secure voice]] communications machine codenamed ''Delilah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended for different applications, lacking capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions, and in any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a [[Winston Churchill]] speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development of [[SIGSALY]], a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.

==Early computers and the Turing test==
[[File:Alan Turing 78 High Street Hampton blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque, 78 High Street, [[Hampton, London|Hampton]]]]
From 1945 to 1947, Turing lived in [[Hampton, London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|1619}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory (NPL)]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Von Neumann]]'s incomplete ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to [[John R. Womersley]], Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it &quot;contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Randell | first = Brian | author-link = Brian Randell | title = A History of Computing in the Twentieth Century: Colossus | year = 1980 | url = http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/research/pubs/books/papers/133.pdf | accessdate =27 January 2012 | ref = harv }} citing {{Cite journal | last = Womersley | first = J.

In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on ''Intelligent Machinery'' that was not published in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Copeland|2004b|pp=410–432}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the world owe much to it, including the [[English Electric DEUCE]] and the American [[Bendix G-15]]. The full version of Turing's ACE was not built until after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/about/history/notable-individuals/turing/|title=Turing at NPL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer [[Heinz Billing]] from the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]], published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Alan Turing and [[Konrad Zuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/Images/Turing_Zuse.pdf|title=Did Alan Turing interrogate Konrad Zuse in Göttingen in 1947?|author=Bruderer, Herbert |accessdate= 7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place in [[Göttingen]] in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were [[John R. Womersley|Womersley]], Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, ''Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz'').

In 1948 Turing was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics Department]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]]. In 1949, he became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there, working on software for one of the earliest [[Von Neumann architecture|stored-program]] computers—the [[Manchester Mark 1]]. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in &quot;[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]&quot; (''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of [[artificial intelligence]], and proposed an experiment that became known as the [[Turing test]], an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called &quot;intelligent&quot;. The idea was that a computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, Stevan]] (2008) [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation Game: On Turing (1950) on Computing, Machinery and Intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (Eds.) ''Parsing the Turing Test: Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A [[Turing test#Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA|reversed]] form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the [[CAPTCHA]] test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.

In 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, [[D. G. Champernowne]], began writing a [[chess]] program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Liat|title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all|publisher=Wired|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he tried to implement it on a [[Ferranti Mark 1]], but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie (1952) &quot;Turing Test&quot;] Chessgames.com&lt;/ref&gt; The program lost to Turing's colleague [[Alick Glennie]], although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife.

His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pinar Saygin | first1 = A. | last2 = Cicekli | first2 = I. | last3 = Akman | first3 = V. | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 10 | issue = 4 | pages = 463–518 | year = 2000 |title=Turing Test: 50 Years Later| doi = 10.1023/A:1011288000451 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also invented the [[LU decomposition]] method in 1948,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287&quot;/&gt; used today for solving matrix equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intusoft.com/nlhtm/nl71.htm |title=SPICE 1 2 3 and beyond&amp;nbsp;...

==Pattern formation and mathematical biology==
Towards the end of his life, Turing turned to [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]], publishing the &quot;[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]&quot; in 1952.

==Conviction for indecency==
In January 1952, Turing, then 39, started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before Christmas outside the [[Dancehouse|Regal Cinema]] when walking down Manchester's [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Road]] and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a  sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both men were charged with [[gross indecency (criminal offence)|gross indecency]] under [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885#Section 11|Section 11]] of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]].&lt;ref name=LeavittP268&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial [[committal procedure|committal proceedings]] for the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor &quot;reserved his defence&quot;, i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the allegations.

Later, convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor, Turing entered a plea of guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |authorlink=Andrew Hodges |last=Hodges |first=Andrew |page=463 |date=27 May 2012 |isbn=0-691-15564-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HyMcH_9eTtoC&amp;pg=PA463&amp;dq=%2227+february%22+%22alan+turing%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%2227%20february%22%20%22alan%20turing%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, ''[[Elizabeth II|Regina]] v. Turing and Murray,'' was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |authorlink=Andrew Hodges |last=Hodges |first=Andrew |page=471 |date=27 May 2012 |isbn=0-691-15564-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HyMcH_9eTtoC&amp;pg=PA471&amp;dq=%22alan+turing%22++Fraser+Harrison#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alan%20turing%22%20%20Fraser%20Harrison&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and probation, which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo [[hormone|hormonal]] treatment designed to reduce [[libido]]. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol (now known as [[diethylstilbestrol]] or DES), a synthetic [[oestrogen]]; this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing [[impotence|impotent]] and caused [[gynaecomastia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition | publisher=Princeton University | author= Hodges, Andrew | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that &quot;no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=16 December 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.lettersofnote.com%2F2012%2F06%2Fyours-in-distress-alan.html |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |authorlink=Andrew Hodges |last=Hodges |first=Andrew  |page=xxviii |date=27 May 2012 |isbn=0-691-15564-X |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGmyLDrbQtQC&amp;pg=PT21&amp;dq=alan+turing+%22lies+with+men%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray was given a conditional discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)]], the British [[signals intelligence]] agency that had evolved from GC&amp;CS in 1946 (though he kept his academic job). He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries. At the time, there was acute public anxiety about homosexual entrapment of spies by Soviet agents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the recent exposure of the first two members of the [[Cambridge Five]], [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]], as [[KGB]] [[double agent]]s. Turing was never accused of espionage, but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the [[Official Secrets Act]] from discussing his war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A [[post-mortem]] examination established that the cause of death was [[cyanide poisoning]]. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at [[Woking Crematorium]] on 12 June 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's ashes were scattered there, just as his father's had been. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, [[David Leavitt]], have both suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), his favourite fairy tale, both noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took &quot;an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=140}} and {{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=149, 489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative death theories===
Philosophy professor [[Jack Copeland]] has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggests an alternative explanation for the cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for gold [[electroplating]] spoons, which uses potassium cyanide to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]].  Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten.&lt;ref name = &quot;Copeland&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first = Roland | last = Pease | title = Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 23 June 2012 | accessdate =23 June 2012 | quote = ''We have&amp;nbsp;... been recreating the narrative of Turing's life, and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide. But the evidence is not there&quot;''
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) &quot;with good humour&quot; and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, even setting down a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend.&lt;ref name = &quot;Copeland&quot;/&gt; At the time, Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Robin Gandy, 28 July 1954, http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/turing-ethel-sara-series-of-11-5685694-details.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Going even further, biographer Andrew Hodges suggests Turing arranged the cyanide experiment deliberately to allow his mother [[plausible deniability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=488, 489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and tributes==
A biography published by the [[Royal Society]] shortly after Turing's death, while his wartime work was still subject to the [[Official Secrets Act]], recorded:
{{quote| Three remarkable papers written just before the war, on three diverse mathematical subjects, show the quality of the work that might have been produced if he had settled down to work on some big problem at that critical time. For his work at the Foreign Office he was awarded the OBE.&lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot;/&gt;}}
Since 1966, the [[Turing Award]] has been given annually by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community. It is widely considered to be the computing world's highest honour, equivalent to the Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases-2007/turingaward/|title=ACM'S Turing Award Prize Raised To $250,000|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] press release|date=27 July 2007|accessdate=16 October 2008|author= Geringer, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 1998, on what would have been Turing's 86th birthday, his biographer, [[Andrew Hodges]], unveiled an official [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]] at his birthplace and childhood home in Warrington Crescent, London, later the Colonnade Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.turing.org.uk/bio/oration.html | title=Unveiling the official Blue Plaque on Alan Turing's Birthplace | accessdate=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.blueplaque.com/detail.php?plaque_id=348 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013143212/http://www.blueplaque.com/detail.php?plaque_id=348 | archivedate=13 October 2007 | title=About this Plaque&amp;nbsp;– Alan Turing | accessdate=25 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; To mark the 50th anniversary of his death, a memorial plaque was unveiled on 7 June 2004 at his former residence, Hollymeade, in [[Wilmslow]], Cheshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|3276}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Turing Plaque.jpg|thumb|left|A [[blue plaque]] marking Turing's home at [[Wilmslow]], Cheshire]]

On 13 March 2000, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] issued a set of postage stamps to celebrate the greatest achievements of the 20th century, one of which carries a portrait of Turing against a background of repeated 0s and 1s, and is captioned: &quot;1937: Alan Turing's theory of digital computing&quot;. On 1 April 2003, Turing's work at [[Bletchley Park]] was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Code-breaking_at_Bletchley_Park_during_World_War_II,_1939-1945 |title=Milestones:Code-breaking at Bletchley Park during World War II, 1939–1945 |author=IEEE History Center |year=2003 |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2004, a bronze statue of Alan Turing sculpted by [[John W. Mills]] was unveiled at the [[University of Surrey]] in [[Guildford]], marking the 50th anniversary of Turing's death; it portrays him carrying his books across the campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;univsurrey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/press/oct2004/281004a/ |title=The Earl of Wessex unveils statue of Alan Turing |accessdate=10 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing was one of four mathematicians examined in the BBC documentary entitled ''Dangerous Knowledge'' (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/dangerous-knowledge.shtml|title=Dangerous Knowledge|publisher=BBC Four|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]'' named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of [[Princeton University]], second only to President [[James Madison]]. A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was unveiled on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh [[slate]], it was sculpted by [[Stephen Kettle]], having been commissioned by the American billionaire [[Sidney Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/454075/article.html Bletchley Park Unveils Statue Commemorating Alan Turing], Bletchley Park press release, 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing has been honoured in various ways in [[Manchester]], the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the [[A6010 road]] (the [[Manchester]] city intermediate ring road) was named &quot;Alan Turing Way&quot;. A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A [[Alan Turing Memorial|statue of Turing]] was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in [[Sackville Park]], between the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]]. The memorial statue depicts the &quot;father of computer science&quot; sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an [[Enigma machine]]: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'.
[[File:Sackville Park Turing plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Turing memorial statue plaque in Sackville Park, Manchester]]
A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a [[Bertrand Russell]] quotation: &quot;Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty&amp;nbsp;— a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.&quot; The sculptor buried his own old [[Amstrad]] computer under the [[plinth]] as a tribute to &quot;the godfather of all modern computers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerburied&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/computer-buried-in-tribute-to-genius-1186583 | title=Computer buried in tribute to genius | work=Manchester Evening News | date=17 February 2007 | accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Turing as one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 Most Important People of the 20th century]] and stated, &quot;The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.&quot;&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news| title =Alan Turing&amp;nbsp;– Time 100 People of the Century |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html |work=Time Magazine |quote=Providing a blueprint for the electronic digital computer.

{{quote|We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of &quot;gross indecency&quot;.

Two years later, he killed himself with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the nation he'd done so much to save. This remains a shame on the [[UK|British]] government and British history. A pardon can go some way to healing this damage.

To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth, the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) co-ordinated the [[Alan Turing Year]], a year-long programme of events around the world honouring Turing's life and achievements. The TCAC, chaired by [[S.

On 23 June 2012, [[Google]] featured an interactive [[Google doodle#Google Doodle|doodle]] where visitors had to change the instructions of a Turing Machine, so when run, the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence, featuring &quot;Google&quot; in [[ITA2|Baudot-Murray code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2012/06/google-doodle-honors-alan-turing/1 |title=Google Doodle honors Alan Turing |newspaper=USA Today |date= 22 June 2012|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
