'''NeXT''' (later '''NeXT Computer''' and '''NeXT Software''') was an American [[computer]] and [[software]] company founded in 1985 by [[Steve Jobs]], based in [[Redwood City, California]], that developed and manufactured a series of computer [[workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]], after he was ousted at Apple, along with several co-workers. NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. The NeXT computers experienced relatively limited sales, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, their innovative [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] and development environment were highly influential.

NeXT later released much of the NeXTSTEP system as a [[Application programming interface|programming environment]] standard called [[OpenStep]]. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing [[OpenStep#OPENSTEP for Mach|OPENSTEP for Mach]], its own OpenStep implementation, for several [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]]. NeXT also developed [[WebObjects]], one of the first enterprise [[Web framework|Web application frameworks]]. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a [[Web server]] based on [[Dynamic web page|dynamic page generation]] rather than on static content.

Apple purchased NeXT in 1997 for $429&amp;nbsp;million and 1.5&amp;nbsp;million shares of Apple stock. As part of the agreement, Steve Jobs, Chairman and CEO of NeXT Software, returned to Apple, the company he had co-founded in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple-acquisition&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|title=Apple Computer, Inc.

==History==

===Background===
In 1985, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the head of Apple's SuperMicro division, which was responsible for the development of the [[Macintosh]] and [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] personal computers. The Macintosh had been successful on university campuses in considerable part because of the [[Apple University Consortium]], which allowed students and institutions to buy the computers at a discount.&lt;ref name=&quot;nextbigthing_p56_p67&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Randall|last=Stross|title=Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing|publisher=Athenium|year=1993|pages=56, 67| isbn=0-689-12135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consortium had sold more than $50&amp;nbsp;million in computers by February 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morrison|first=Jas|title=NeXT, Microsoft tackle objects: NT to gain OpenStep port|work=Fortune|date= February 20, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While chairman, Jobs visited university departments and faculty members to sell Macintosh. Jobs met [[Paul Berg]], a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, at a luncheon held in [[Silicon Valley]] to honor [[François Mitterrand]], then [[President of France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nextbigthing_p72&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Randall|last=Stross|title=Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing|publisher=Athenium|year=1993|page=72| isbn=0-689-12135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shannon|first=Victoria|title=Apple losing its polish in Franc| work=[[International New York Times|International Herald Tribune]]|page=11|date=May 22, 2006|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/21/business/lobbyside.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060602104905/http://iht.com/articles/2006/05/21/business/lobbyside.php|archivedate=June 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berg was frustrated by the expense of teaching students about [[recombinant DNA]] from textbooks instead of in [[Wet laboratory|wet laboratories]], used for the testing and analysis of chemicals, drugs, and other materials or biological matter. Wet labs were prohibitively expensive for lower-level courses and were too complex to be simulated on personal computers of the time. Berg suggested to Jobs to use his influence at Apple to create a &quot;[[3M computer]]&quot; workstation for higher education, featuring more than one [[megabyte]] of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), a [[Pixel#Megapixel|megapixel]] display and [[FLOPS|megaFLOP]] performance, hence the name &quot;3M&quot;.

Jobs was intrigued by Berg's concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher education computer company in the fall of 1985, amidst increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs' division did not release upgraded versions of the Macintosh and most of the [[Macintosh Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The [[board of directors]] sided with Sculley while Jobs took a business visit to [[Western Europe]] and the [[Soviet Union]] on behalf of Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jeffrey S. | last=Young |author2=Simon, William L. | title=iCon: Steve Jobs | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2005 | page=118 | isbn=0-471-72083-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Original NeXT team===
After several months of being sidelined, Jobs resigned from Apple on September 13, 1985. He told the board he was leaving to set up a new computer company, and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him. He also told the board that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing its designs back to them to market under the Macintosh brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Jobs named his new company Next, Inc. A number of former Apple employees followed him to Next, including  [[Joanna Hoffman]], [[Bud Tribble]], [[George Crow]], [[Rich Page]], [[Susan Barnes (computing)|Susan Barnes]], [[Susan Kare]], and Dan'l Lewin. After consulting with major educational buyers from around the country, including a follow-up meeting with Paul Berg, a tentative specification for the workstation was drawn up. It was designed to be powerful enough to run wet lab simulations and cheap enough for college students to use in their dormitory rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;secondcoming&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Alan | last=Deutschman | title=Second Coming of Steve Jobs | publisher=Broadway Books | year=2000 | page=64|isbn=0-7679-0432-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the specifications were finished, however, Apple sued Next for &quot;nefarious schemes&quot; to take advantage of the cofounders' [[Insider|insider information]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nextbigthing_p75&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Randall|last=Stross|title=Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing|publisher=Athenium|year=1993|page=75| isbn=0-689-12135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stross 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deutschman, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Jobs remarked, &quot;It is hard to think that a $2&amp;nbsp;billion company with 4,300-plus people couldn't compete with six people in blue jeans.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stross_book&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Randall|last=Stross|title=Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing|publisher=Athenium|year=1993| isbn=0-689-12135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suit was eventually dismissed before trial.

In 1986, Jobs recruited the famous graphic designer [[Paul Rand]] to create a brand identity costing $100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;rand&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Steven | last=Heller |author2=Helfand, Jessica |author3=Lois, George | title=Paul Rand | publisher=Phaidon Press | year=2000 | page= 256|isbn=0-7148-3994-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand created a 100-page brochure detailing the brand, including the precise angle used for the logo (28°) and a new company name, NeXT.&lt;ref name=&quot;rand&quot;/&gt; The first major outside investment was from [[Ross Perot]], who invested after seeing a segment about NeXT on ''The Entrepreneurs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|sOlqqriBvUM}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, he invested $20&amp;nbsp;million in exchange for 16&amp;nbsp;percent of NeXT's stock and subsequently joined the board of directors in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jeffrey S. | last=Young |author2=Simon, William L. | title=iCon: Steve Jobs | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2005 | page=134 | isbn=0-471-72083-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1987–93: NeXT Computer===

====First generation====
[[Image:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This original NeXT Computer was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]], and became the world's first [[Web server]] and ran the [[WorldWideWeb|world's first Web browser]] in 1990]]
NeXT changed its business plan in mid-1986. The company decided to develop both computer hardware and software, instead of just a low-end workstation. A team led by [[Avie Tevanian]], who had joined the company after working as one of the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach kernel]] engineers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], was to develop the NeXTSTEP operating system. The hardware division, led by [[Rich Page]]&amp;nbsp;— one of the cofounders who had previously led the [[Apple Lisa]] team&amp;nbsp;— designed and developed the hardware. NeXT's first factory was completed in [[Fremont, California]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stross_book&quot;/&gt; It was capable of producing 150,000 machines per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stross_book&quot;/&gt; NeXT's first workstation was officially named the [[NeXT Computer]], although it was widely termed &quot;the cube&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;byte&quot;/&gt; because of its distinctive case, a 1&amp;nbsp;ft magnesium cube, designed by [[Apple IIc]] case designer [[Frog Design Inc.|Frogdesign]] in accordance with an edict from Jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The original design team had anticipated releasing the computer for [[United States dollar|US$]]3,000 in spring of 1987 to be ready for sale by summer of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Steve Jobs building NeXT | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHsHKzYOV2E}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NeXT Computer received standing ovations when revealed at a lavish, invitation-only gala event, &quot;[[NeXT Introduction]]&amp;nbsp;— the Introduction to the NeXT Generation of Computers for Education&quot; at the [[Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall]], [[San Francisco]], California on Wednesday October 12, 1988. The following day, selected educators and software developers were invited (for $100 registration fee) to attend the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at an event called &quot;The NeXT Day&quot; held at the San Francisco Hilton. This event gave developers interested in developing NeXT software an insight into the software architecture, [[object-oriented programming]] and developing for the NeXT Computer. The luncheon speaker was Steve Jobs.

The first machines were tested in 1989, after which NeXT started selling limited numbers to universities with a [[Software testing#Beta testing|beta]] version of the NeXTSTEP operating system installed. Initially the NeXT Computer was targeted at U.S. [[higher education]] establishments only, with a base price of $6,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;byte&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

The machine was widely reviewed in magazines, generally concentrating on the hardware. When asked if he was upset that the computer's debut was delayed by several months, Jobs responded, &quot;Late? This computer is five years ahead of its time!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Robert | last=Standefer | title=Macintosh Switcher's Guide | publisher=Wordware Publishing | year=2004 | chapter=Evolution of Mac OS X | page =33| isbn=1-55622-045-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NeXT Computer was based on the new 25&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68030]] [[central processing unit]] (CPU). The [[Motorola 88000]] [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Takahashi |first = Ken | title = Motorola making chips in Japan | work = Newsbytes | date = August 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included between 8 and 64 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[random-access memory]] (RAM), a 256 MB [[magneto-optical drive|magneto-optical]] (MO) drive, a 40 MB ([[Paging|swap]]-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB [[hard disk drive]], 10BASE2 [[Ethernet]], [[NuBus]] and a 17-inch ''[[NeXT MegaPixel Display|MegaPixel]]'' grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 [[pixel]]s. In 1989 a typical new PC, [[Macintosh]], or [[Amiga]] computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few [[Computer network|networking]] capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

It also was the first computer to ship with a general-purpose DSP chip (Motorola 56001) on the motherboard. This was used to support sophisticated music and sound processing, including the [[Music Kit]] software.

The magneto-optical drive manufactured by [[Canon Inc.]] was used as the primary [[mass storage]] device. These drives were relatively new to the market, and the NeXT was the first computer to use them.&lt;ref name=&quot;magneto-optical&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The design made it impossible to move files between computers without a network, since each NeXT Computer had only one MO drive and the disk could not be removed without shutting down the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;magneto-optical&quot; /&gt; Storage options proved challenging for the first NeXT Computers. The magneto-optical media was relatively expensive and had performance and reliability problems despite being faster than a floppy drive.&lt;ref name=&quot;magneto-optical&quot; /&gt; The drive was not sufficient to run as the primary medium running the NeXTSTEP operating system both in terms of speed and capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;magneto-optical&quot; /&gt;

In 1989, NeXT struck a deal for former [[Compaq]] reseller Businessland to sell NeXT computers in select markets nationwide. Selling through a retailer was a major change from NeXT's original business model of only selling directly to students and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/25/business/company-news-businessland-deal-seen-for-next-inc.html | title=Businessland Deal Seen for Next Inc. | date=March 25, 1989 | agency= Reuters | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Businessland founder David Norman predicted that sales of the NeXT Computer would surpass sales of Compaq computers after 12&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Shaffer, Richard | title=NeXT means business now. | work=Personal Computing | date=July 1989 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Canon invested US$100&amp;nbsp;million in NeXT, giving it a 16.67&amp;nbsp;percent stake,&lt;ref name=&quot;canon&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=McCarthy, Vance | title=Steve Jobs just says no. | work=Fortune | date=July 17, 1993 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; making NeXT worth almost $600&amp;nbsp;million. Canon invested in NeXT with the condition that it would be able to use the NeXTSTEP environment with its own workstations, which would mean a greatly expanded market for the software. After NeXT exited the hardware business, Canon produced a line of PCs, called ''object.station'', including models 31, 41, 50 and 52, specifically designed to run NeXTSTEP/Intel.&lt;ref name=object&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford|first=Kevin|title=Canon object.station 41|url=http://www.kevra.org/TheBestOfNext/ThirdPartyProducts/ThirdPartyHardware/NeXTSTEPonNonNeXTComputers/IntelHardwareForNeXTStep/Canon-object-station41/Canon-object-station41/Canon-object-station41.html|publisher=The Best of NeXT Computers|accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canon also served as NeXT's distributor in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Garfinkel | first =Simon L | title =Open Door Policy | publisher =NeXTWORLD | date = April 1994 | url=http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/94.4/94.4.Apr.Japan1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NeXT computers were first released on the retail market in 1990, for $9,999. NeXT's original investor Ross Perot resigned from the board of directors in June 1991 to dedicate more time to [[Perot Systems]], a [[Plano, Texas]]-based systems integrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = NeXT may expand two-man board | work = PC Week | page = 125 | date = December 9, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second generation====
[[Image:NeXTstation.jpg|thumb|A [[NeXTstation]] with the original keyboard, mouse and the [[NeXT MegaPixel Display|NeXT MegaPixel]] monitor]]
NeXT released a second generation of workstations in 1990. The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the [[NeXTcube]], and the [[NeXTstation]], nicknamed &quot;the slab,&quot; which used a &quot;[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]&quot; case form-factor. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff did not use the latter terminology, lest the NeXT machines be compared to competing Sun workstations. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive to offer users a way to use their floppy disks. However, individual 2.88 MB floppies were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new [[Motorola 68040]] processor.

In 1992, NeXT launched &quot;Turbo&quot; variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation with a 33&amp;nbsp;MHz 68040 processor and maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992 (NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as sales)&amp;nbsp;— a small number compared with their competitors. However, the company reported sales of $140&amp;nbsp;million for the year, encouraging Canon to invest a further $30&amp;nbsp;million to keep the company afloat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jeffrey S. | last=Young |author2=Simon, William L. | title=iCon: Steve Jobs | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2005 | page= 200 | isbn=0-471-72083-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 50,000 NeXT machines were sold,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=NeXT Fans Give Up the Ghost| work=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] | url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2005/12/69888?currentPage=1 | accessdate=March 3, 2011 | date=December 21, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629034820/http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2005/12/69888?currentPage=1|archivedate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including thousands to the then super secret [[National Reconnaissance Office]] located in Chantilly, Virginia.  NeXT's long-term aim was to migrate to the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture, a processor design strategy intended to increase performance. The project was known as the [[NeXT RISC Workstation]] (NRW). Initially the NRW was to be based on the [[Motorola 88000#Implementations|Motorola 88110]] processor, but due to a lack of confidence in Motorola's commitment to the 88000-series architecture, it was later redesigned around dual [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 601|PowerPC 601s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hardware was great while it lasted | work=NeXTWORLD| author=Garfinkel, Simson L. |date=March 1993| url=http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/93.03.Mar.NWE/93.03.Mar.NWExtra21.html| accessdate=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canon to buy NeXT factory, design center| work=NeXTWORLD | author=Lavin, Dan |date=March 1993|url=http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/NextWorld_Extra/93.03.Mar.NWE/93.03.Mar.NWExtra07.html | accessdate=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; NeXT produced some motherboards and enclosures, but exited the hardware business before full production.

NeXT was an engineering computer used by professors for the most serious science challenges, and also for developing finished newspaper layouts using News running on Next. [[George Mason University]] in the early 1990s had a set of them for publishing, as well as Silicon Graphics for CAD/GL and Mathematica for astrophysics. The games ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'', ''[[Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' were [[Development of Doom#Programming|developed]] by [[id Software]] on NeXT machines. Other games based on the [[Doom engine]], such as ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'' and ''[[Hexen: Beyond Heretic]]'' by [[Raven Software]], as well as ''[[Strife (video game)|Strife]]'' by [[Rogue Entertainment]] were also developed on NeXT hardware using id's tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rome.ro/2006/12/apple-next-merger-birthday.html |title=Apple-NeXT Merger Birthday!|author=John Romero|date=December 20, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305165006/http://rome.ro/2006/12/apple-next-merger-birthday.html|archivedate=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commercial programs were released for NeXT computers, including Altsys Virtuoso, a vector drawing program with page-layout features which was ported to Mac OS and Microsoft Windows as Aldus FreeHand v4, and the [[Lotus Improv]] [[spreadsheet]] program. The systems also came with a number of smaller built-in applications, such as the [[Merriam-Webster]] Collegiate Dictionary, [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] Quotations, the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]], and the ''Digital Librarian'' search engine to access them.

===1993–96: NeXT Software===
[[Image:NeXTSTEP desktop.png|thumb|[[NeXTSTEP]], the [[operating system]] used by the NeXTcube and NeXTstation]]
NeXT started [[porting]] the NeXTSTEP operating system to [[IBM PC compatible]] computers using the [[Intel 80486]] processor in late 1991. The operating system was ported to Intel's architecture because of a change in NeXT's business strategy, which was then to remove themselves from the hardware business entirely. A demonstration of the port was displayed at the NeXTWorld Expo in January 1992.  By mid-1993 the product was complete and version 3.1, also known as NeXTSTEP 486, was released. Prior to the release of NeXTSTEP, [[Chrysler]] planned to buy 3,000 copies in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Next Computer Close To a Deal With Chrysler | date=September 8, 1992 | work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NeXTSTEP 3.x was later ported to [[PA-RISC]]&lt;ref name=&quot;RISC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Sherman | first =Lee | title =First NeXT RISC Workstation | work =NeXTWORLD | year =2004 | url =http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/94.4/94.4.Apr.PA-RISC1.html | accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SPARC]]-based platforms, for a total of four versions: NeXTSTEP/NeXT (for NeXT's 68k &quot;black boxes&quot;), NeXTSTEP/Intel, NeXTSTEP/PA-RISC and NeXTSTEP/SPARC. Although these ports were not widely used, NeXTSTEP gained popularity at institutions such as [[Bank One Corporation|First Chicago NBD]], [[Swiss Bank Corporation]], O'Connor and Company, and other organizations owing to its programming model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

NeXT withdrew from the [[Orphaned technology|hardware]] business in 1993 and the company was renamed NeXT Software Inc; consequently, 300 of the 540 staff employees were laid off.&lt;ref name=&quot;employees&quot;/&gt; NeXT negotiated to sell the hardware business, including the Fremont factory, to Canon.&lt;ref name=&quot;employees&quot;/&gt; Canon later pulled out of the deal. Work on the PowerPC machines was stopped, along with all hardware production. CEO of [[Sun Microsystems]] [[Scott McNealy]] announced plans to invest $10&amp;nbsp;million in 1993 and use NeXT software (OpenStep) in future Sun systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Sun invests in Next, which will license NextStep OS for Sparc. | work=InfoWorld | date=November 29, 1993 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; NeXT partnered with Sun to create [[OpenStep]] which was NeXTSTEP without the Mach-based kernel.

After dropping the hardware business, NeXT returned to selling a toolkit to run on other operating systems, in effect returning to the original business plan. New products based on OpenStep were released, including OpenStep Enterprise, a version for Microsoft's [[Windows NT]]. The company also launched [[WebObjects]], a platform for building large-scale dynamic web applications. Many large businesses including [[Dell]], [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[MCI Inc.|WorldCom]], and the [[BBC]] used this WebObjects software for a short time.&lt;ref name=&quot;webobjects&quot;&gt;{{cite web | date= June 16, 2005 | first=Johnny | last=Evans | title=Apple releases WebObjects as a free application | work=[[MacCentral]] | url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/news/index.cfm?NewsID=11860 | accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern day, [[WebObjects]] is used almost solely to power Apple's [[iTunes Store]] and most of its corporate Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date= June 2, 2003 | last=Dalrymple | first=Jim | title=Xserves power iTunes Music Store, 'America 24/7' | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/24637/2003/06/xserve.html | work= [[Macworld]] | accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–97: Apple merger===
Apple Computer announced an intention to acquire NeXT on December 20, 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple-acquisition&quot; /&gt; Apple paid $429&amp;nbsp;million in cash, which went to the initial investors and 1.5&amp;nbsp;million Apple shares, which went to [[Steve Jobs]], who was deliberately not given cash for his part in the deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple-acquisition&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
| title = Apple files with SEC for Jobs to sell 1.5 million shares

Several NeXT executives replaced their Apple counterparts when Steve Jobs restructured the company's board of directors. Over the next five years the NeXTSTEP operating system was ported to the [[PowerPC]] architecture. At the same time, an Intel port and OpenStep Enterprise toolkit for Windows were both produced. The operating system was code named [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=August 6, 1997 | title=What's NeXT? | work=MacObserver | first=Arlen | last=Britton | url=http://www.macobserver.com/columns/whatsnext/articles/080697.shtml | accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the toolkit for development on all platforms was called &quot;Yellow Box&quot;. For backwards compatibility Apple added the &quot;Blue Box&quot; to Rhapsody, allowing existing Mac applications to be run in a self-contained cooperative multitasking environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A server version of the new operating system was released as [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] in 1999, and the first consumer version, [[Mac OS X]], in 2001. The OpenStep developer toolkit was renamed [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]. Rhapsody's Blue Box was renamed [[Classic Environment]] and changed to run applications full-screen without requiring a separate window. Apple included an updated version of the original Macintosh toolbox, called [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]], that gave existing Mac applications access to the environment without the constraints of Blue Box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

NeXTSTEP's processor-independent capabilities were retained in Mac OS X, leading to both PowerPC and Intel x86 versions (although only PowerPC versions were publicly available before 2006). Apple moved to Intel processors by August 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Apple to Use Intel Microprocessors Beginning in 2006 | url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2005/jun/06intel.html | publisher=Apple Computer|date=June 6, 2005 | accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate culture and community==
Jobs created a different corporate culture at NeXT in terms of facilities, salaries, and benefits. Jobs had experimented with some structural changes at Apple but at NeXT he abandoned conventional corporate structures, instead making a &quot;community&quot; with &quot;members&quot; instead of employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeXTBigThing2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Randall | last=Stross | title=Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing | publisher=Athenium | year=1993 | page=80 | isbn=0-689-12135-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only two different salaries at NeXT until the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeXTBigThing2&quot;/&gt; Team members who joined before 1986 were paid $75,000 while those who joined afterwards were paid $50,000. This caused a few awkward situations where managers were paid less than their employees. Employees were given performance reviews and raises every six months because of the spartan salary plans. To foster openness, all employees had full access to the payrolls, although few employees ever took advantage of the privilege.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeXTBigThing2&quot;/&gt; NeXT's [[health insurance]] plan offered benefits to not only married couples but unmarried couples and same-sex couples, although the latter privilege was later withdrawn due to insurance complications.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeXTBigThing2&quot;/&gt; The payroll schedule was also very different from other companies in Silicon Valley at the time: instead of getting paid twice a month at the end of the pay period, employees would get paid once a month in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Jobs found office space in [[Palo Alto, California]] on 3475 Deer Creek Road,&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleConfidential&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Owen W. | last=Linzmayer | title=Apple Confidential 2.0 | publisher=No Starch Press | year=2004 | page=323|isbn=1-59327-010-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; occupying a glass and concrete building which featured a staircase designed by architect [[I. M. Pei]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleConfidential&quot;/&gt; The first floor used hardwood flooring and large worktables where the workstations would be assembled. To avoid inventory errors, NeXT used the [[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]] (JIT) inventory strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleConfidential&quot;/&gt; The company contracted out for all major [[wikt:component|components]] such as mainboards and cases and had the finished components shipped to the first floor for assembly. The second floor was the office space with an open floor plan. The only enclosed rooms were Jobs's office and a few conference rooms.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleConfidential&quot;/&gt;

As NeXT expanded, more office space was needed. The company rented an office at 800 and 900 Chesapeake Drive in Redwood City,&lt;ref name=&quot;NeXTBigThing2&quot;/&gt; also designed by Pei. The architectural centerpiece was a &quot;floating&quot; staircase with no visible supports. The open floor plan was retained, although furnishings became luxurious, with $5,000 chairs, $10,000 sofas and [[Ansel Adams]] prints.&lt;ref name=&quot;NeXTBigThing2&quot;/&gt;

NeXT's first former campus in Palo Alto was subsequently occupied by [[SAP SE|SAP AG]]. Its second former campus in Redwood City was occupied by ApniCure and [[OncoMed|OncoMed Pharmaceuticals Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The NeXT big thing: OncoMed finds a home | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2007/10/29/focus6.html?page=all | publisher=American City Business Journals|date=October 28, 2007 | accessdate=June 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issue of ''NeXTWORLD'' magazine was printed in 1991. It was published in [[San Francisco]] by Integrated Media and edited by Michael Miley and later Dan Ruby. It was the only mainstream periodical to discuss NeXT computers, the operating system, and NeXT software. Publication was discontinued in 1994 after only four volumes were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Serial Archive Listings for NeXTWORLD | website=The Online Books Page | url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/serial?id=nextworld| accessdate=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''NeXTWORLD Expo'' followed as a developer [[Convention (meeting)|conference]], held in 1991 and 1992 at the San Francisco Civic Center and in 1993 and 1994 at the [[Moscone Center]] in San Francisco, with Steve Jobs as the keynote speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=NeXT makes play for corporate market | work=PC Week | author=NextStep users seek safety in big numbers | date=January 27, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on the computer industry==
Steve Jobs pooled the finest of over-specified hardware and software into NeXT, and also the company added innovations of their own.  As such, it was the machine of choice for well-funded science departments that, of course, were [[Unix]]-friendly at the time.

Despite NeXT's limited commercial success, the company had a wide-ranging impact on the computer industry. [[Object-oriented programming]] and [[graphical user interface]]s became more common after the 1988 release of the NeXTcube and NeXTSTEP, when other companies started to emulate NeXT's object-oriented system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Smith, Carrie | title=NeXT means business now. | work=Wall Street &amp; Technology | date=May 1994 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple started the [[Taligent]] project in 1989, with the goal of building a NeXT-like operating system for the Macintosh, with collaboration from both [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Microsoft announced the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo project]] in 1991; the Cairo specification included similar object-oriented user interface features for a coming consumer version of Windows NT. Although the project was ultimately abandoned, some elements were integrated into other projects. By 1994, Microsoft and NeXT were collaborating on a Windows NT-port of OpenStep; the port, however, was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Smith, Carrie | title=NeXT, Microsoft tackle objects: NT to gain OpenStep port. | work=PC Week | date=November 7, 1994 | publisher=[[InfoTrac|General Reference Center Gold]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WebObjects]] failed to achieve wide popularity partly because of the initial high price of US$50,000,&lt;ref name=birthdaywo&gt;{{cite web |work=MacObserver|url=http://www.macobserver.com/article/2006/03/28.14.shtml |title=Happy Birthday: WebObjects at 10 |accessdate=June 13, 2008 |last=Stewart |first=Graham |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it remains the first and most prominent early example of a web application server that enabled dynamic page generation based on user interactions as opposed to static content. WebObjects is now bundled with [[OS X Server]] and [[Xcode]].&lt;ref name=birthdaywo/&gt;
