'''Paul Desmond''' (born '''Paul Emil Breitenfeld'''; November 25, 1924 – May 30, 1977) was an American [[jazz]] [[alto saxophone|alto saxophonist]] and composer, best known for the work he did in the [[Dave Brubeck]] Quartet and for composing that group's greatest hit, &quot;[[Take Five]]&quot;. He was one of the most popular musicians to come out of the [[West Coast jazz|West Coast]]'s [[cool jazz]] scene.

In addition to his work with [[Dave Brubeck|Brubeck]], he led several of his own groups and engaged in significant collaborations with artists such as [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], and [[Ed Bickert]].  After years of [[chain smoking]] and general poor health, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 following one last tour with Brubeck.

==Early life==
Desmond was born '''Paul Emil Breitenfeld''' in San Francisco, California, in 1924, the son of Shirley (née King) and Emil Aron Breitenfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCwIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=father+Emil+Breitenfeld&amp;dq=father+Emil+Breitenfeld&amp;hl=en|title=Take five|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was from a Jewish family from Bohemia and Austria, and his mother was Catholic; throughout his life, Desmond was unsure of his father's background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCwIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Shirley+King+Emil+Breitenfeld&amp;dq=Shirley+King+Emil+Breitenfeld&amp;hl=en|title=Take five|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCwIAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Take+five:+the+public+and+private+lives+of+Paul+Desmond%22&amp;dq=%22Take+five:+the+public+and+private+lives+of+Paul+Desmond%22&amp;hl=en|title=Take five|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Paul-Desmond/6000000007890667448?through=6000000016605369866|title=Paul Desmond|work=geni_family_tree}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His father was a pianist, organist, and composer, who accompanied silent films in movie theaters and arranged for music companies. His mother was emotionally unstable throughout his upbringing. During childhood he spent years living with relatives in New York City due to problems at home. Desmond began playing violin at an early age, though his father forbade him to play it.&lt;ref name=&quot;doyle&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Doyle|first = Brian|authorlink = |title = Spirited Men: Story, Soul, and Substance |publisher = [[Cowley Publications]]|year = 2004|pages = 73–74|doi = |isbn = 1-56101-258-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Desmond began to study [[clarinet]] at the age of twelve, which he continued while at [[San Francisco Polytechnic High School]]. Paul was not only a gifted musician, but a talented writer who took an early interest in show business.  As co-editor of his high school newspaper, he helped secure an interview with Bob Hope during his visit to San Francisco.  It was not until he became a freshman at [[San Francisco State College]] that he picked up the [[alto saxophone]]. In his first year Desmond was drafted into the [[United States Army]] and joined the Army band while stationed in San Francisco. He spent three years in the military, but his unit was never called to combat.&lt;ref name=&quot;doyle&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
Following the conclusion of [[World War II]], Desmond started working outside [[Palo Alto, California]], at the Band Box, 3401 El Camino Real, Redwood City.&lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/rc53_32.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~npmelton/rc53_860.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/2013/04/paul-desmond-a-life-told-in-pictures-music-and-memories/|title=Paul Desmond:  A Life Told in Pictures, Music and Memories|work=Jerry Jazz Musician}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked with Brubeck at the Geary Cellar in San Francisco. Desmond soon hired Brubeck, but cut his pay in half and then replaced him altogether after taking him along to [[Graeagle]] at The Feather River Inn for gigs; this was done so Desmond could gamble in nearby [[Reno]]. In 1950 Desmond left for New York City playing alto and clarinet for [[Jack Fina]], but returned to California after hearing Brubeck's trio on the radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;doyle&quot;/&gt;

The story of their encounter is somewhat humorous. Brubeck—married with three children and holding a grudge from his earlier experience with Desmond—instructed his wife, Iola, not to let him set foot in his house. However, Desmond came to his home in San Francisco one day while Dave was out back hanging diapers on a laundry line, and Iola let him in and took him to Brubeck. Apparently all the begging in the world would not convince Brubeck to hire him, at least not until Desmond offered to babysit Brubeck's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;doyle&quot;/&gt;

==Dave Brubeck Quartet==
{{main article|The Dave Brubeck Quartet}}
{{Quote box|width=300px|quote=Some people called him the stork—'Cause he would stand on one leg and leaned on the piano. But that... that was when he was playing great. What used to scare me is I'd look at him and it would just be whites in his eyes, wouldn't be any eyeballs.|source='''Dave Brubeck'''&lt;br/&gt;([[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] interview with [[Hedrick Smith]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Smith|first = Hedrick|title = Dave on Paul Desmond and the Quartet|url=http://www.pbs.org/brubeck/talking/daveOnPaul.htm |date= June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Desmond had first met [[Dave Brubeck]] in 1944 while still in the military. Brubeck was trying out for the 253rd Army band which Desmond belonged to. After making the cut he—unlike Desmond—was sent to war in 1944. Desmond once told [[Marian McPartland]] of [[National Public Radio]]'s ''Piano Jazz'' that he was taken aback by the chord changes Brubeck introduced during that 1944 audition. After convincing Brubeck to hire him following his stint with [[Jack Fina]], the two had a contract drafted (of which Brubeck was the sole signatory); the language forbade Brubeck from ever firing him, ensured Brubeck's status as group leader, and gave Desmond twenty percent of all profits generated from the quartet.&lt;ref name=&quot;doyle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lees&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Lees|first = Gene|authorlink = |title = Cats of Any Color: Jazz Black and White |publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2001|pages = 55–57|doi = |isbn = 0-306-80950-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is how the Dave Brubeck Quartet had its start, a group that began in 1951 and ended in December 1967. The quartet became especially popular with college-age audiences, often performing in college settings like on their ground-breaking 1953 album ''[[Jazz at Oberlin]]'' at [[Oberlin College]], or on their recordings on the campuses of [[Ohio University]] and the [[University of Michigan]], among others. The success of the quartet led to a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine piece on them in 1954, with the famous cover featuring Brubeck's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Martin|first = Henry|authorlink = |title = Essential Jazz: The First 100 Years |publisher = [[Thomson Wadsworth]]|year = 2004|page = 314|doi = |isbn = 0-534-63810-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group played until 1967, when Brubeck switched his musical focus from performance to composition and broke the unit up. During the 1970s Desmond joined Brubeck for several reunion tours, including &quot;Two Generations of Brubeck&quot;. Accompanying them were Brubeck's sons [[Chris Brubeck]], Dan Brubeck and [[Darius Brubeck]]. In 1976 Desmond played 25 shows in 25 nights with Brubeck, touring the United States in several cities by bus.

==Other collaborations==
{{Quote box|align=left|width=250px|quote=Playing with Desmond and Mulligan was really mind-blowing because they were such heroes for me.|source='''Perry Robinson'''&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson&quot;/&gt;}}
In June 1969 Desmond appeared at the [[New Orleans Jazz Festival]] with [[Gerry Mulligan]], procuring favorable reactions from critics and audience members.&lt;ref name=&quot;doyle&quot;/&gt; During Brubeck's ''Two Generations'' tours, Desmond and Mulligan shared the stage together in 1974. Unlike Brubeck, Mulligan personally shared much in common with Desmond. The two shared similar interests and humor, and both men had no shortage of addictions in their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson&quot;/&gt;
{{Clear}}

After some time spent inactive, Desmond was asked to play the Half Note in New York City in 1971 by guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]]. With his special brand of humor, Desmond said that he took the job only because he was nearby and could tumble out of bed to work. The two continued to play at the club to jam-packed audiences. Desmond also joined [[The Modern Jazz Quartet]] for a Christmas concert in 1971 at the New York Town Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;doyle&quot;/&gt;

Desmond recorded the tune &quot;Summertime&quot;, along with many others, during his time with [[Chet Baker]].

Desmond met Canadian guitarist [[Ed Bickert]] through Hall in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] and began performing with him at several clubs in the Toronto area. Bickert played in the Paul Desmond Quartet at the [[Edmonton]] Jazz Festival, and they recorded several albums together.

==Personal life==
In their private lives Dave Brubeck and his family were very close to Paul Desmond, though the two men possessed very different personalities. Darius Brubeck recalls thinking that Desmond was his uncle almost into adolescence. Desmond grew especially close to Dave's son Michael, to whom he left his saxophone upon death. Desmond also was described as a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] who was unable to form, or uninterested in maintaining, steady relationships with women, though he had no shortage of them throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, Ted (1998). ''West Coast Jazz'', Ch 4: &quot;Dave Brubeck and Modern Jazz in San Francisco&quot;; University of California Press, 1998 ISBN 0520217292&lt;/ref&gt;  Desmond is reported to have quipped, upon seeing a former girlfriend on the street, &quot;There she goes, not with a whim but a banker&quot; (a [[Spoonerism]] reference to T.S. Eliot's &quot;This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper&quot;). In contrast, Brubeck was a stalwart family man.&lt;ref name=&quot;lees&quot;/&gt;{{Quote box|width=250px|quote=I have won several prizes as the world's slowest alto player, as well as a special award in 1961 for quietness. |source='''Paul Desmond'''&lt;ref name=&quot;isms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = |first = |title = Paul Desmond-isms |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=19154#.Uj7KMmTwLyd|accessdate = 2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Desmond was quite well-read and retained a unique wit. He enjoyed reading works by the thinkers of his generation like [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Jack Kerouac]], also dabbling in some [[LSD]] usage. He was known to have several addictions, including [[Dewar's]] [[Scotch whisky]] and [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]] cigarettes. His chemical-dependency problems would sometimes drain him of his energy on the road. Clarinetist [[Perry Robinson]] recalls in his autobiography that Desmond would sometimes need a [[vitamin B12]] shot just to go on playing during his later career.&lt;ref name=&quot;robinson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Robinson|first = Perry|authorlink = Perry Robinson|title = Perry Robinson: The Traveler |publisher = iUniverse|year = 2002|pages = 190–191|doi = |isbn = 0-595-21538-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote box|align=left|width=225px|quote=Pristine, perfect. One of the great livers of our time. Awash in Dewar's and full of health.|source='''Paul Desmond'''&lt;ref name=&quot;isms&quot;/&gt;}} 
Desmond died on May 30, 1977, not of his heavy alcohol habit but of lung cancer, the result of his longtime heavy smoking.  Never without his humor, after he was diagnosed with cancer he expressed pleasure at the health of his liver. His last concert was with Brubeck in February 1977, in New York City. His fans did not know that he was already dying.  Desmond specified in his will that all proceeds from &quot;Take Five&quot; would go to the [[Red Cross]] following his death. Desmond reportedly owned a Baldwin grand piano, which he lent to [[Bradley Cunningham]], owner of Bradley's piano bar in [[Greenwich Village]], with the condition that Cunningham had to move the large piano back to Desmond's Upper West Side apartment to become part of Desmond's estate.  After this long and expensive process, Desmond willed the piano to Cunningham, a characteristic and final prank.  
The Paul Desmond Papers are held at the Holt-Atherton Special Collections in the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] Library.

Desmond was cremated and his ashes were scattered.

==Style==
Desmond produced a light, melodic tone on the alto saxophone, he said he tried to sound &quot;like a dry [[martini (cocktail)|martini]].&quot; With a style that was similar to that of [[Lee Konitz]], one of his influences, he quickly became one of the best-known saxophonists from the [[West Coast jazz|West Coast]]'s [[cool jazz|cool school of jazz]]. Much of the success of the classic Brubeck quartet was due to the juxtaposition of his airy style over Brubeck's sometimes relatively heavy, [[polytonality|polytonal]] piano work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Owens|first = Thomas|authorlink = |title = Bebop: The Music and Its Players |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|year = 1995|page = 68|doi = |isbn = 0-19-510651-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His rare gift for [[improvisation|improvised]] [[counterpoint]] is perhaps most evident on the two albums he recorded with baritone saxophonist [[Gerry Mulligan]] (''Mulligan-Desmond Quartet'' and ''[[Two of a Mind]]'').  Desmond's playing was also notable for his ability to produce extremely high notes, the [[altissimo]] register, on his saxophone.

Desmond played a [[Selmer Paris|Selmer]] ''Super Action'' model alto saxophone coupled with an M. C. Gregory model 4A-18M hard rubber mouthpiece, both dating from circa 1951, with a moderately stiff Rico 3 ½ reed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ramsey-setup&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Doug|title=Take Five:  The Public and Private Lives of Paul Desmond|year=2005|publisher=Parkside Publications|location=Seattle|isbn=0-9617266-7-9|pages=102, 118, 216, 292|ref=ramsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
