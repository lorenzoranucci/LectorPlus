'''Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi''' ({{IPA-hi|ˈɪnːdɪrə ˈɡaːnd̪ʱi|lang|Hi-IndiraGandhi.ogg}}; {{née}} '''Nehru'''; 19 November 1917 – 31 October 1984) was an Indian politician and central figure of the [[Indian National Congress]] party, and to date the only female [[Prime Minister of India]]. Indira Gandhi was the daughter of [[India]]'s first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|her assassination]] in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister of India after her father. 
  
Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964.  She was elected [[Congress President]] in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964,  Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]]. In the Congress Party's parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966, upon the death of [[Lal Bahadur Shastri|Shastri]], she defeated her rival, [[Morarji Desai]], to become leader; and, thus, succeeded Shastri as Prime Minister of India.

As the Prime Minister of India, Gandhi was known for her political ruthlessness and unprecedented [[centralisation of power]]. She went to [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]] with [[Pakistan]] in support of the [[6 Point Movement|independence movement]] and [[Bangladesh Liberation War|war of independence]] in [[East Pakistan]], which resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of [[Bangladesh]], as well as increasing India's influence to the point where it became the regional [[hegemon]] of [[South Asia]]. Gandhi also presided over a controversial [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] from 1975 to 1977 during which she [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]]. She was assassinated in 1984 by her [[Sikh]] bodyguards a few months after she ordered the [[Operation Blue Star|storming of the Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] to counter the [[Punjab insurgency]].

In 1999, Indira was named &quot;Woman of the Millennium&quot; in a poll organised by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/543743.stm |title=Indira Gandhi 'greatest woman' |publisher=BBC News |date=1 December 1999 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Indira Gandhi was born Indira Nehru in a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] family on 19 November 1917 in [[Allahabad]].{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=13}} Her father, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], was a leading figure in India's political [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] from [[British Raj|British rule]], and became the first Prime Minister of the [[Union of India|Union]] (and later [[Republic of India|Republic]]) of India.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=3}} She was the only child (a younger brother was born, but died young),{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=31}} and grew up with her mother, [[Kamala Nehru]], at the [[Anand Bhavan]]; a large family estate in Allahabad.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=16}} She had a lonely and unhappy childhood.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=25}} Her father was often away, directing political activities or being incarcerated in prison, while her mother was frequently bed-ridden with illness, and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=32}} She had limited contact with her father, mostly through letters.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=55}}

Indira was mostly taught at home by tutors, and intermittently attended school until matriculation in 1934.  She was a student at the [[Modern School (New Delhi)|Modern School]] in [[Delhi]], St Cecilia's and St Mary's Christian convent schools in [[Allahabad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupte|first1=Pranay|title=Mother India : a political biography of Indira Gandhi / Pranay Gupte.|date=2011|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143068266|pages=151–152|edition=Rev. ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OOmK1lPWq80C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=allahabad+St+Cecilia%27s+school&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bR_NrcVtLy&amp;sig=G7LZMg9s4Bc5cxYD2E7Ks0OmgBY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJreGkkMbOAhVE6CYKHRlMDqgQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=allahabad%20St%20Cecilia's%20school&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International School of Geneva]], the Ecole Nouvelle in [[Bex]], and the Pupils' Own School in [[Poona]] and [[Bombay]], which is affiliated to [[University of Mumbai]]. {{sfn|Frank|2010|pp=29,75,83}} She and her mother [[Kamala Nehru]] moved to [[Belur Math]] headquarters of [[Ramakrishna Mission]] where [[Swami Ranganathananda]] was her guardian{{sfn|Indira Gandhi: Daughter of India|2002|pp=42,43,45}}  later she went on to study at the [[Viswa Bharati University]] in [[Shantiniketan]]. It was during her interview that [[Rabindranath Tagore]] named her Priyadarshini, and she came to be known as Indira Priyadarshini Nehru.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=90}} A year later, however, she had to leave university to attend to her ailing mother in [[Europe]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=170}} While there, it was decided that Indira would continue her education at the [[University of Oxford]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=181}} After her mother died, she briefly attended the [[Badminton School]] before enrolling at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] in 1937 to study history.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=116}} Indira had to take the entrance examination twice, having failed at her first attempt with a poor performance in Latin.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=116}} At Oxford, she did well in history, political science and economics, but her grades in Latin—a compulsory subject—remained poor.{{sfn|Somervill|2007|p=36}}{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=184}}  She did, however, have an active part within the student life of the university, such as the [[Oxford Majlis Asian Society]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordmajlis.wix.com/majlis&lt;/ref&gt;

During her time in Europe, Indira was plagued with ill-health and was constantly attended by doctors. She had to make repeated trips to Switzerland to recover, disrupting her studies. She was being treated there in 1940, when the Nazi armies rapidly conquered Europe. Gandhi tried to return to England through Portugal but was left stranded for nearly two months. She managed to enter England in early 1941, and from there returned to India without completing her studies at Oxford. The university later awarded her an honorary degree. In 2010, Oxford further honoured her by selecting her as one of the ten Oxasians, illustrious Asian graduates from the [[University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/100422_1.html |title=Exhibit celebrates 120 years of South Asians at Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102074542/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/100422_1.html |archivedate=2 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her stay in Great Britain, Indira frequently met her future husband [[Feroze Gandhi]] (no relation to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), whom she knew from Allahabad, and who was studying at the [[London School of Economics]]. The marriage took place in [[Allahabad]] according to [[Adi Dharm]] rituals though Feroze belonged to a [[Zorastrian]] [[Parsi]] family of Gujarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/82389/ |title=Sonia assures help for father-in-law’s grave |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=21 November 2005 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Indira, now Mrs. Indira Gandhi after her marriage, served her father unofficially as a personal assistant during his tenure as the first [[Prime Minister of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steinberg|first1=Blema S.|title=Women in power : the personalities and leadership styles of Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, and Margaret Thatcher|date=2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=978-0-7735-3356-1|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=EZIBxpeRXxsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=indira+nehru+hostess&amp;ots=KxnZhb-GM_&amp;sig=KTRxwvYwYf1FDPuygycMypLs4aw#v=onepage&amp;q=indira%20nehru%20hostess&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the 1950s, Indira Gandhi served as the President of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]]. In that capacity, she was instrumental in getting  the Communist led [[Government of Kerala|Kerala]] State Government dismissed in 1959. That government had the distinction of being India's first ever elected [[Communist]] Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Upadhyaya|first1=Prakash Chandra|title=Review of Marxist State Governments in India, Politics, Economics and Society by T.

After her father's death in 1964 she was appointed as a member of the [[Rajya Sabha]] (upper house) and became a member of [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]]'s cabinet as [[Minister of Information and Broadcasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Indira.

==The first term as Prime Minister between 1966 and 1971==
Following a poor showing in the [[Indian general election, 1967|1967 general election]], Indira Gandhi started progressively moving to the left in the political spectrum. In 1969, after falling out with senior party leaders on a number of issues, the party president [[S. Nijalingappa]] expelled her from the party.&lt;ref name=socialism&gt;{{cite news|title=March to socialism under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi|accessdate=25 June 2014|work=[[The Economic Times]]|agency=Bennett, Coleman &amp; Co.

The policies of the Congress under Indira Gandhi,  prior to the 1971 elections, also included proposals for the  abolition of [[Privy Purse in India|Privy Purse]] to former rulers of the [[Princely states]] and the 1969 nationalization of the fourteen largest banks in India.

The internal structure of the Congress Party had withered following its numerous splits, leaving it entirely dependent on her leadership for its election fortunes. ''[[Garibi Hatao]]'' (Eradicate Poverty) was the theme for Gandhi's 1971 bid. On the other hand, the combined opposition alliance had a two word manifesto of &quot;Indira Hatao&quot; (Remove Indira).&lt;ref name=&quot;1971.iz iz result&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=General Elections, India, 1971: Statistical report|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/statisticalreports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf|website=http://eci.nic.in/|publisher=[[Commission of India]]|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masani,|first1=Zareer|title=The Indira Wave|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/article2950165.ece|accessdate=8 January 2015|issue=March 3, 2012|publisher=The Hindu|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Garibi Hatao slogan and the proposed [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty programs]] that came with it were designed to give Gandhi an independent national support, based on rural and urban poor. This would allow her to bypass the dominant rural castes both in and of state and local governments; likewise the urban commercial class. And, for their part, the previously voiceless poor would at last gain both political worth and political weight. The programs created through [[Garibi Hatao]], though carried out locally, were funded and developed by the Central Government in New Delhi. The program was supervised and staffed by the [[Indian National Congress]] party. &quot;These programs also provided the central political leadership with new and vast patronage resources to be disbursed... throughout the country.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rath, Nilakantha|title='Garibi Hatao': Can IRDP Do It?|year=1985|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=20|issue=6 |pages=238–246|jstor=4374060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest achievement of Indira Gandhi after the 1971 election was India's decisive victory in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], that led to the formation of independent [[Bangladesh]]. Some sources claim she was hailed as Goddess Durga by opposition leader [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellmann-Rajanayagam|first1=D|title=Dynasties and Female Political Leaders in Asia: Gender, Power and Pedigree|date=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag GMBH|location=Vienna, Zurich|isbn=978-3-643-90320-4|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UKBcLhCxSvQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=indira+durga+vajpayee+bangladesh&amp;ots=ix1RPPkZ37&amp;sig=aQ-zGKtFahKhTnPqTkjdIBChYwA#v=onepage&amp;q=indira%20durga%20vajpayee%20bangladesh&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puri|first1=Balraj|title=Indian Muslims since Partition|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=1993|volume=28|issue=40|page=2144|jstor=4400229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanghavi, Nagindas. &quot;From Navnirman to the anti-Mandal riots: the political trajectory of Gujarat (1974–1985).&quot; South Asian History and Culture 1.4 (2010): 480–493.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the elections held for State assemblies across India in March 1972, the Congress(R) swept to power in most states riding on the post-war &quot;Indira wave&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rudolph|first1=Lloyd|last2=Rudolph|first2=Susanne|title=India's Election: Backing into the future|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=July 1977|volume=55|issue=4|page=836|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/20039739?sid=21105590184633&amp;uid=366524361&amp;uid=364592321&amp;uid=60&amp;uid=76&amp;uid=364567631&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739864&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=366524351|accessdate=8 January 2015|doi=10.2307/20039739}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the victory against Pakistan, the Congress government faced numerous problems during this term. Some of these were due to  high inflation which was in turn caused by war time expenses, drought in some parts of the country and more importantly, the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The opposition to Gandhi in 1973–75 period, after the Indira wave had receded, was strongest in Bihar and Gujarat. In Bihar, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], the veteran leader came out of retirement to lead the protest movement there.&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor.org&quot;/&gt;

===Verdict on electoral malpractice===
On 12 June 1975, the [[High Courts of India|High Court of Allahabad]] declared Indira Gandhi's election to the [[Lok Sabha]] void on grounds of electoral malpractice. In an election petition filed by [[Raj Narain]] (who later on defeated her in 1977 parliamentary election from [[Raebareli|Rae Bareily]]), he had alleged several major as well as minor instances of using government resources for campaigning.,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511691.stm |work=BBC News  | title=1975: Gandhi found guilty of corruption | date=12 June 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Priyadarshi, D., 1975. Case Study: Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi vs. Shri Raj Narain and Anr. on 7 November 1975. Indira Nehru Gandhi vs. Shri Raj Narain and Anr. on, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The court thus ordered her stripped of her parliamentary seat and banned from running for any office for six years. The Prime Minister must be a [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|member]] of either the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house in the [[Parliament of India]]) or a [[Member of parliament, Rajya Sabha|member]] of the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house). Thus, this decision effectively removed her from office. Gandhi had asked one of her colleagues in government, Mr. [[Ashoke Kumar Sen]] to defend her in court.

But Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. The verdict was delivered by Mr Justice [[Jagmohanlal Sinha]] at Allahabad High Court. It came almost four years after the case was brought by Raj Narain, the premier's defeated opponent in the 1971 parliamentary election. Gandhi, who gave evidence in her defence during the trial, was found guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenditure, and of using government machinery and officials for party purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511691.stm |work=BBC News  | title=1975: Gandhi found guilty of corruption | date=12 June 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge, however, rejected more serious charges of bribery against her.
[[File:Indira and Nixon.JPG|thumb|upright|With [[Richard Nixon]], 1971]]
Gandhi insisted that the conviction did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: &quot;There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments&quot;. And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. &quot;Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe the prime minister of India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise&quot;.

===State of Emergency (1975–1977)===
{{Main article|The Emergency (India)}}
Gandhi moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. Her Cabinet and government then recommended that President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declare a [[state of emergency]] because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision. Accordingly, Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on 25 June 1975.

===Rule by decree===

Within a few months, [[President's Rule]] was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] thereby bringing the entire country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the ruling Congress party.&lt;ref&gt;Kochanek, Stanely, ''Mrs. Gandhi's Pyramid: The New Congress'', (Westview Press, Boulder, CO 1976) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
Police were granted powers to impose curfews and indefinitely detain citizens and all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]. Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were indefinitely postponed, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on recommendation of the state's governor.

Indira Gandhi used the emergency provisions to change conflicting party members.

Unlike her father Jawaharlal Nehru, who preferred to deal with strong chief ministers in control of their legislative parties and state party organizations, Mrs. Gandhi set out to remove every Congress chief minister who had an independent base and to replace each of them with ministers personally loyal to her...Even so, stability could not be maintained in the states...&lt;ref&gt;Brass, Paul R., ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', ([[Cambridge University Press]], England 1995) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;}}

President Ahmed issued [[decree|ordinances]] that did not require debate in the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]], allowing Gandhi to [[rule by decree]].

===Rise of Sanjay===
The Emergency saw the entry  of Gandhi's younger son, [[Sanjay Gandhi|Sanjay]], into Indian Politics. Sanjay wielded tremendous power during the emergency without holding any Government office.  According to [[Mark Tully]], &quot;His inexperience did not stop him from using the Draconian powers his mother, Indira Gandhi, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tully ''Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle'', p. 55, ISBN 81-291-0917-4&lt;/ref&gt;

It was said that during the Emergency he virtually ran India along with his friends, especially [[Bansi Lal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Subodh Ghildiyal|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-12-29/india/28661327_1_slum-clearance-sanjay-gandhi-sterilization|title=Cong blames Sanjay Gandhi for Emergency ‘excesses’|publisher=Times Of India|date=29 December 2010|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also quipped that Sanjay Gandhi had total control over his mother and that the government was run by the PMH (Prime Minister House) rather than the PMO (Prime Minister Office).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/26022710/Mystery-Called-Sanjay-Gandhi |title=Mystery Called Sanjay Gandhi|publisher=Scribd|date=21 November 2007|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Express News Service|title=Emergency 'propagandist' who banned Kishore Kumar songs|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/emergency-propagandist-who-banned-kishore-kumar-songs/1127804/|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=Indian Express|date=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Life of Indira Gandhi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dasgupta|first=Swapan|journal=Third World Quarterly|title=Sanjay Gandhi|date=July 1985|volume=7|issue=3|doi=10.1080/01436598508419863|pages=731–778}}&lt;!--|accessdate=17 January 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==1977 election and opposition years==
In 1977, after extending the state of emergency twice, Indira Gandhi called elections to give the electorate a chance to vindicate her rule. Gandhi may have grossly misjudged her popularity {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about her. In any case, she was opposed by the Janata alliance of Opposition parties. Janata alliance, with Jai Prakash Narayan as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between &quot;democracy and dictatorship.&quot; 
The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD (Congress for Democracy), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that.
Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. 
The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]. The other leaders of the Janata Party were [[Charan Singh]], [[Raj Narain]], [[George Fernandes]]  and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].

===In opposition and return to power===
[[File:1984 CPA 5588.jpg|thumb|right|upright|1984 [[USSR]] commemorative stamp]]

Since Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed [[Yashwantrao Chavan]] as their parliamentary  party leader. Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with Gandhi floating her own Congress (I) faction. She won a by-election from the [[Chikamagalur]] constituency to the [[Lok sabha]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maramkal|first1=M-B|title=Chikmagalur remembers Indira Gandhi|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/Chikmagalur-remembers-Indira-Gandhi/articleshow/26064352.cms|issue=November 20|publisher=Times of India|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Janata government's Home Minister, Choudhary [[Charan Singh]], ordered the arrest of her and Sanjay Gandhi on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Indira Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament. These allegations included that she &quot;‘had planned or thought of killing all opposition leaders in jail during the Emergency’&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, Inder. Indira Gandhi. New York: Coronet Books, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to her arrest, Indira Gandhi's [[Bholanath and Devendra Pandey|supporters hijacked]] an Indian Airlines jet and demanded her immediate release.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19781221&amp;id=ZOAzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lDIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3674,5934855] {{Dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this strategy backfired disastrously. Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or &quot;that woman&quot; as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the  government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]].  The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress (I). After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979. Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, by President Reddy, after Indira and Sanjay Gandhi promised Singh that Congress (I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions.,&lt;ref name=&quot;Supporting Charan Singh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Mesquita|first1=Bruce Bueno|title=The Predictioneer's Game: Using the Logic of Brazen Self-Interest to See and shapte the future|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-7977-0|page=xxiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8BafGvdAYYEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=indira+gandhi+%22charan+singh%22&amp;ots=ipC0QGvfrR&amp;sig=WSGY3FV2d4Ip5OHljLiajnyxsDA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charan%20singh%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Charan Singh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sanghvi|first1=Vijay|title=The Congress, Indira to Sonia Gandhi  By|date=2006|publisher=Kalpaz|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7835-340-7|pages=114–122|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=npdqD_TXucQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=indira+to+soniya+congress&amp;ots=5RE4QuraUJ&amp;sig=BhhnMjsCiFzwZvEIrP5QX2EVork#v=onepage&amp;q=charan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay.  Since Charan Singh refused to drop the charges, Congress (I) withdrew its support and President Reddy dissolved Parliament in August 1979.

Before the 1980 elections Gandhi approached the then [[Shahi Imam]] of [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]], [[Syed Abdullah Bukhari]] and entered into an agreement with him on the basis of 10-point programme to secure the support of the Muslim votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;AgnihotriRay2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=S.

==1980 elections and third term==
The Congress (I) under Gandhi swept back to power in January 1980. Elections soon after to State assemblies across the country also brought back Congress ministries in the state with Indira's son [[Sanjay Gandhi]] choosing loyalists to lead the states. Sanjay died soon after in an air crash, early into this term. Sanjay Gandhi died instantly from head wounds in an air crash on 23 June 1980 near [[Safdarjung Airport]] in New Delhi.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sanjay Gandhi|[15]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He was flying a new aircraft of the Delhi Flying club, and, while performing an [[Aerobatic maneuver|aerobatic manoeuvre]] over his office, lost control and crashed.

===Operation Blue Star ===
{{Main article|Operation Blue Star}}

In the 1977 elections, a coalition led by the [[Sikh]]-majority [[Akali Dal]] came to power in the northern Indian state of Punjab. In an effort to split the Akali Dal and gain popular support among the Sikhs, Indira Gandhi's Congress helped bring the orthodox religious leader [[Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale]] to prominence in Punjab politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gus2011&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Gus Martin|title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Terrorism, Second Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I_jh4VBi_HYC&amp;pg=PA543|accessdate=11 October 2012|date=15 June 2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-8016-6|pages=543–545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christine2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.

Indian army used heavy artillery such as tanks and cannons and machine guns in addition with helicopters to crush the Sikhs of Harmindar Sahib. In the resulting [[Operation Blue Star]], the shrine was damaged and many civilians were brutally massacred. Which started a swim of riot in Punjab and as a result many religious Sikh leaders as well as many devotees of Harminder Sahib were arrested, tortured and killed. Still there is a long list of missing persons from Sikh religious community of Punjab being abducted by state agencies, police and army. The State of Punjab was closed to international media, its phone and communication lines shut. To this day the events remain controversial with a disputed number of victims; Many Sikhs seeing the attack as unjustified and Bhindrawale being declared the greatest Sikh martyr of the 20th century by [[Akal Takht]] (Sikh Political Authority) in 2003.

Gandhi's approach to dealing with Sri Lanka's [[Sri Lankan Civil War|ethnic problems]] was initially accommodating. She enjoyed cordial relations with Prime Minister [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]].

India's relationship with Pakistan remained strained following the [[Simla Agreement|Shimla Accord]] in 1972. Gandhi's [[Smiling Buddha|authorization of the detonation of a nuclear device]] at Pokhran in 1974 was viewed by Pakistani leader [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] as an attempt to intimidate Pakistan into accepting India's hegemony in the subcontinent. However, in May 1976, Gandhi and Bhutto both agreed to reopen diplomatic establishments and normalize relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grover&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=

===Middle East===
[[File:Pahlavis meet Indira Gandhi in India, 1970.jpg|thumb|left|Indira Gandhi meeting the [[Shah of Iran]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] and [[Shahbanu]] [[Farah Pahlavi]] during their state visit to India in 1970]]
Gandhi remained a staunch supporter of Palestinians in the [[Arab-Israeli conflict]] and was critical of the Middle East diplomacy sponsored by the United States.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=5}} [[Israel]] was viewed as a religious state and thus [[Two nation theory|an analogue]] to India's archrival Pakistan. Indian diplomats also hoped to win Arab support in countering Pakistan in [[Kashmir]]. Nevertheless, Gandhi authorized the development of a secret channel of contact and security assistance with Israel in the late 1960s. Her lieutenant, [[P. V. Narasimha Rao|Narasimha Rao]], later became Prime Minister and approved full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;AKapur&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Ashok|last=Kapur|title=India: From Regional to World Power|location=|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|page=215|isbn=978-0415328043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India's pro-Arab policy had mixed success. Establishment of close ties with the socialist and secular [[Baathist]] regimes to some extent neutralized Pakistani propaganda against India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Anjali|last=Ghosh|title=India's Foreign Policy|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2009|pages=306–307|isbn=978-8131710258}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]  put the Arab and Muslim states of the Middle East in a dilemma as the war was fought by two states both friendly to the Arabs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaur&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Ranjit|last=Kaur|title=Islamic Co-Operation and Unity|location=|publisher=Deep and Deep Publications|year=1993|pages=168–170|isbn=978-8171005642}}&lt;/ref&gt; The progressive Arab regimes in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Algeria]] chose to remain neutral, while the conservative pro-American Arab monarchies in [[Jordan]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]], and [[United Arab Emirates]] openly supported Pakistan. Egypt's stance was met with dismay by the Indians, who had come to expect close co-operation with the Baathist regimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;/&gt; But, the death of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] in 1970 and [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s growing friendship with [[Riyadh]], and his mounting differences with Moscow, constrained Egypt to a policy of neutrality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;/&gt; Gandhi's overtures to [[Muammar Gaddafi]] were rebuffed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaur&quot;/&gt; [[Libya]] agreed with the Arab monarchies in believing that Gandhi's intervention in East Pakistan was an attack against [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaur&quot;/&gt;

The 1971 war temporarily became a stumbling block in growing [[India–Iran relations|Indo-Iranian ties]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;/&gt; Although Iran had earlier characterized the Indo-Pakistani war in 1965 as Indian aggression, the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] had launched an effort at rapprochement with India in 1969 as part of his effort to secure support for a larger Iranian role in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;/&gt; Gandhi's tilt towards Moscow and her dismemberment of Pakistan was perceived by the Shah as part of a larger anti-Iran conspiracy involving India, [[Iraq]], and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Iran had resisted Pakistani pressure to activate the [[Baghdad Pact]] and draw in the [[Central Treaty Organisation]] (CENTO) into the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh&quot;/&gt; Gradually, Indian and Iranian disillusionment with their respective regional allies led to a renewed partnership between the nations.&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunter|first=Shireen|title=Iran's Foreign Policy in the Post-Soviet Era: Resisting the New International Order|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0804755504|date=2010|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi was unhappy with the lack of support from India's Arab allies during the war with Pakistan, while the Shah was apprehensive at the growing friendship between Pakistan and the Gulf states, specially Saudi Arabia, and the growing influence of Islam in Pakistani society.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; There was an increase in Indian economic and military co-operation with [[Iran]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; The 1974 India-Iranian agreement led to Iran supplying nearly 75 percent of India's crude oil demands.&lt;ref name=pande&gt;{{cite book|last=Pande|first=Aparna|title=Explaining Pakistan's Foreign Policy|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis, 2011|isbn=978-1136818943|year=2011|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi appreciated the Shah's disregard of [[Pan-Islamism]] in diplomacy.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt;

===Asia-Pacific===
One of the major developments in [[Southeast Asia]] during Gandhi's premiership was the formation of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in 1967. Relations between ASEAN and India was mutually antagonistic. ASEAN in the Indian perception was linked to the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO), and it was therefore, seen as a pro-American organisation. On their part, the ASEAN nations were unhappy with Gandhi's sympathy for the [[Viet Cong]] and India's strong links with the [[USSR]]. Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's future plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971. India's entry into the nuclear weapons club in 1974 contributed to tensions in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name=Nanda&gt;{{cite book|last=Nanda|first=Prakash|title=Rediscovering Asia: Evolution of India's Look-East Policy|publisher=Lancer Publishers|isbn=978-8170622970|year=2003|pages=220–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations only began to improve following Gandhi's endorsement of the [[Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality|ZOPFAN declaration]] and the disintegration of the SEATO alliance in the aftermath of Pakistani and American defeats in the region. Nevertheless, Gandhi's close relations with reunified [[Vietnam]] and her decision to recognize the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]] in 1980 meant that India and ASEAN were not able to develop a viable partnership.&lt;ref name=Nanda/&gt;

===Africa===

Although independent India was initially viewed as a champion of anti-colonialism, its cordial relationship with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and liberal views of British colonial policies in [[East Africa]] had harmed its image as a staunch supporter of the anti-colonial movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Anjali|last=Ghosh|title=India's Foreign Policy|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2009|pages=422–424|isbn=978-8131710258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian condemnation of militant struggles in [[Mau Mau Uprising|Kenya]] and [[Algerian War|Algeria]] was in sharp contrast to China, who had supported armed struggle to win African independence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;/&gt; After reaching a high diplomatic point in the aftermath of Nehru's role in the [[Suez Crisis]], India's isolation from Africa was complete when only four nations; [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Libya]] supported her during the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;/&gt; After Gandhi became Prime Minister, diplomatic and economic relations with the states which had sided with India during the Sino-Indian War were expanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;/&gt; Gandhi began negotiations with the Kenyan government to establish the Africa-India Development Cooperation. The Indian government also started considering the possibility of bringing Indians settled in Africa within the framework of its policy goals to help recover its declining geo-strategic influence. Gandhi declared the people of Indian origin settled in Africa as &quot;Ambassors of India.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;/&gt; Efforts to rope in the Asian community to join Indian diplomacy, however, came to naught, partly because of the unwilligness of Indians to remain in politically insecure surroundings and partly due to the exodus of African Indians to Britain with the passing of the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968|Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;/&gt; In [[Uganda]], the African Indian community even [[Expulsion of Asians from Uganda|suffered persecution and eventually expulsion]] under the government of [[Idi Amin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oonk&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Gijsbert|last=Oonk|title=Global Indian Diasporas: Exploring Trajectories of Migration and Theory|location=|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2007|page=189|isbn=978-9053560358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign and domestic policy successes in the 1970s enabled Gandhi to rebuild India's image in the eyes of African states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;/&gt; Victory over Pakistan and India's possession of nuclear weapons showed the degree of India's progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, the conclusion of the Indo-Soviet treaty in 1971 and threatening gestures by the major western power, the United States, to send its nuclear armed [[Task Force 74]] into the [[Bay of Bengal]] at the height of the East Pakistan crisis had enabled India to regain its anti-imperialist image.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ghosh2&quot;/&gt; Gandhi firmly tied Indian anti-imperialist interests in Africa to those of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mawdsley&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

In this context, Gandhi was accused of formulating populist policies to suit her political needs; being seemingly against the rich and big business while preserving the status quo in order to manipulate the support of the left at times of political insecurity, such as the late 1960s.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

''The Indian Libertarian'' wrote that: &quot;it would be difficult to find a more machiavellian leftist than Mrs Indira Gandhi...for here is [[Machiavelli]] at its best in the person of a suave, charming and astute politician.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Libertarian, Volume 15–17. 1969. University of Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.

Datta-Ray; ''Indira Gandhi: Enigma, Mother-Goddess and Terror Incernate''. 3 November 1994. The Straits Times (Singapore).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, others were more convinced of Gandhi's sincerity and devotion to socialism. Pankaj Vohra noted that &quot;even the late prime minister’s critics would concede that the maximum number of legislations of social significance was brought about during her tenure...[and that] she lives in the hearts of millions of Indians who shared her concern for the poor and weaker sections and who supported her politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aam aadmi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsPankajVohra/The-original-aam-aadmi-leader/Article1-471695.aspx |title=The original aam aadmi leader |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date=1 November 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513074215/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/ColumnsPankajVohra/The-original-aam-aadmi-leader/Article1-471695.aspx |archivedate=13 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: &quot;I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [socialism] because it came closest to what we wanted to do here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it. I don't believe in words at all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg&quot;/&gt; Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon.

The period of 1967–75 was characterized by socialist ascendency in India which culminated in 1976 with the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|official declaration of state socialism]]. Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the ''Fourth Five-Year Plan'' in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, &quot;growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.&quot;{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Gupta&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale behind the overall plan was Gandhi's ''Ten Point Programme'' of 1967. This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasized greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalization process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as &quot;protectionist as ever.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kirk&quot;/&gt;

To deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosser&quot;/&gt; The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s and transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains and prone to famine to being largely able to feed itself, and become successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic period of 1967–75 became significant for its major wave of nationalisations amidst the increased regulation of the private sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosser&quot;/&gt;

Some of the other objectives of the economic plan for the period was to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 program were accomplished by 1974–75. Nevertheless, the success of the overall economic plan was tempered by the fact that annual growth at 3.3–3.4% over 1969–74 fell short of the targeted figure.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}

===State of Emergency and the Fifth Five Year Plan===

The Fifth Five Year Plan (1974–79) was enacted in the backdrop of the state of emergency and the ''Twenty Point Program'' of 1975.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} The latter was the economic rationale of the emergency, a political act which has often been justified on economic grounds.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} In contrast to the reception of Gandhi's earlier economic plan, this one was criticized for being a &quot;hastily thrown together wish list.&quot;{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Gandhi promised to reduce poverty by targeting the consumption levels of the poor and enact wide ranging social and economic reforms. The government additionally targeted an annual growth of 4.4% over the period of the plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growth statistics&quot;/&gt;

The measures of the emergency regime was able to halt the economic trouble of the early to mid-1970s, which had been marred by harvest failures, fiscal contraction, and the breakdown of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of fixed exchanged rate; the resulting turbulence in the foreign exchange markets being further accentuated by the oil shock of 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nayak&quot;/&gt; The government was even able to exceed the targeted growth figure with an annual growth rate of 5.0–5.2% over the five-year period of the plan (1974–79).&lt;ref name=&quot;Growth statistics&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} The economy grew at the rate of 9% in 1975–76 alone, and the Fifth Plan, became the first plan during which the per capita income of the economy grew by over 5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

The government targeted an average growth of 5.2% over the period of the plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growth statistics&quot;/&gt; Measures to check the inflation were also taken; by the early 1980s inflation was under control at an annual rate of about 5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lal&quot;/&gt;

Although Gandhi continued professing socialist beliefs, the Sixth Five Year Plan was markedly different from the years of [[Garibi Hatao]]. Populist programs and policies were replaced by pragmatism.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} There was an emphasis on tightening public expenditures, greater efficiency of the [[Government-owned corporation|State Owned Enterprises]] (SOE), which Gandhi qualified as a &quot;sad thing&quot;, and in stimulating the private sector through deregulation and liberation of the capital market.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterbury&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Waterbury|title=Exposed to Innumerable Delusions: Public Enterprise and State Power in Egypt, India, Mexico, and Turkey|location=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1993|page=58|isbn=978-0521434973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government subsequently launched ''Operation Forward'' in 1982, the first cautious attempt at reform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rendezvous&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/sunanda-k-datta-ray-rendezvousronnie/152623/ |title=Sunanda K Datta Ray: Rendezvous with Ronniel |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=12 June 2004 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Plan went on to become the most successful of the Five Year plans yet; showing an average growth of 5.7% over 1980–85.&lt;ref name=&quot;Growth statistics&quot;/&gt;

===Inflation and unemployment===

[[File:Oil Prices Since 1861.svg|thumb|The price of oil during the 1970s energy crisis. The graph shows sharp increases in 1973 and again in 1979]]
During Lal Bahadur Shastri's last full year in office (1965), inflation averaged 7.7%, compared to 5.2% at the end of Gandhi's first stint in office (1977).&lt;ref name=&quot;inflation&quot;&gt;Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy; ''Basic Statistics Relating to the Indian Economy''.

The government was successful in bringing down inflation during the emergency; achieving negative figures of −1.1% by the end of 1975–76.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inflation&quot;/&gt;

Gandhi inherited a tattered economy in her second term; harvest failures and a [[1979 energy crisis|second oil shock]] in the late 1970s had again caused inflation to rise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harley&quot;/&gt; During [[Charan Singh]]'s last year in office (1980), inflation averaged 18.2%, compared to 6.5% during Gandhi's last year in office (1984).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inflation&quot;/&gt; General economic recovery under Gandhi led to an average inflation at 6.5% from 1981–82 to 1985–86; the lowest since the beginning of India's inflation problems in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kapila&quot;/&gt;

===Nationalisation===

Despite the provisions, control and regulations of [[Reserve Bank of India]], most banks in India had continued to be owned and operated by private persons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gomez&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Clifford|last=Gomez|title=Financial Markets Institutions And Financial Services
|location=|publisher=PHI|year=2008|page=283|isbn=978-8120335370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies, and ignoring the [[Priority sector lending|priority sector]]. Furthermore, there was a great resentment against ''class'' banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority population) [[unbanked]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Off the record&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Akshat Kaushal|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/offrecord/436974/ |title=Off the record |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=28 May 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After becoming Prime Minister, Gandhi expressed the intention of nationalising the banks in a paper titled, ''&quot;Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation&quot;'' in order to alleviate poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muralidharan1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=|last=Muralidharan|title=Modern Banking: Theory And Practice
|location=|publisher=PHI|year=2009|page=364|isbn=978-8120336551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper received the overwhelming support of the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muralidharan1&quot;/&gt; In 1969, Gandhi moved to nationalise fourteen major commercial banks. After the nationalisation of banks, the branches of the public sector banks in India rose to approximate 800 percent in deposits, and advances took a huge jump by 11,000 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muralidharan2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=|last=Muralidharan|title=Modern Banking: Theory And Practice
|location=|publisher=PHI|year=2009|page=4|isbn=978-8120336551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationalisation also resulted in a significant growth in the geographical coverage of banks; the number of bank branches rose from 8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened in the unbanked, rural areas. The nationalization drive not only helped to increase household savings, but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India’s industrial and agricultural base.&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Kavaljit|last=Singh|title=Questioning Globalization
|location=|publisher=Zed Books|year=2005|page=45|isbn=978-1842772799}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], who became famous for leading the opposition to Gandhi in the 1970s, was solid in his praise for her bank nationalisations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Off the record&quot;/&gt;

Having been re-elected in 1971 on a nationalisation platform, Gandhi proceeded to nationalise the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton textiles, and insurance industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosser&quot;/&gt; Most of these nationalisations were made to protect employment and the interest of the organised labour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosser&quot;/&gt; The remaining private sector industries were placed under strict regulatory control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosser&quot;/&gt;

During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], foreign-owned private oil companies had refused to supply fuel to the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force. In response, Gandhi nationalised oil companies in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 4, 2015|title=Energy Geopolitics – An Overview|url=http://greatgameindia.com/energy-geopolitics-an-overview/|journal=GreatGameIndia Magazine|issue=July–Sept 2015 issue|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nationalisation the oil majors such as the [[Indian Oil Corporation]] (IOC), the [[Hindustan Petroleum Corporation]] (HPCL) and the [[Bharat Petroleum Corporation]] (BPCL) had to keep a minimum stock level of oil, to be supplied to the military when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ved |last=Luthra|title=Poverty And Economic Reforms|location=New Delhi|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|year=2005|page=293|isbn=978-8178901367}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administration===
[[File:Territorial evolution of India 1961–1975.png|left|thumb|530px|Administrative divisions of India 1961–1975. Gandhi established six states, [[Haryana]] (1966), [[Himachal Pradesh]] (1971), [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]] (all 1972), and finally [[Sikkim]] (1975), bringing up the total of states to 22. She also established [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Mizoram]] (1972) as Union Territories]]

In 1966, Gandhi [[Punjabi Suba movement|accepted the demands]] of the [[Akali Dal|Akali's]] to reorganize [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] on linguistic lines. The [[Hindi]]-speaking southern half of Punjab became a separate state, [[Haryana]], while the [[Pahari languages|Pahari]] speaking hilly areas in the north east were joined to [[Himachal Pradesh]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=302}} In doing so, she had hoped to ward off [[Punjabi Suba#Background|the growing political conflict]] between [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] groups in the region.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=302}} However, a contentious issue that was considered unresolved by the Akali's was the status of [[Chandigarh]], a prosperous city on the Punjab-Haryana border, which Gandhi declared a union territory to be shared as a capital by both the states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pletcher&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first= Kenneth|last=Pletcher|title=The History of India|location=|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2010|page=315|isbn=978-1615302017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victory over Pakistan in 1971 consolidated Indian power in Kashmir. Gandhi indicated that she would make no major concessions on Kashmir. The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, [[Sheikh Abdullah]], had to recognize India's control over Kashmir in light of the new order in South Asia. The situation was normalized in the years following the war after Abdullah [[1974 Indira–Sheikh accord|agreed to an accord]] with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a [[Article 370|special autonomous status for Kashmir]]. In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. The transition to statehood for these territories was successfully overseen by her administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra 2007b&quot;/&gt; This was followed by the annexation of [[Sikkim]] in 1975.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=120-121}}

Gandhi questioned the continued existence of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]] for Indian monarchs. She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. They, however, received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.

Gandhi claimed that only &quot;clear vision, iron will and the strictest discipline&quot; can remove poverty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; She justified the imposition of the state of emergency in 1975 in the name of the socialist mission of the Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; Armed with the power to rule by decree and without constitutional constraints, Gandhi embarked on a massive redistribution program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; The provisions included rapid enforcement of land ceilings, housing for landless labourers, the abolition of bonded labour and a moratorium on the debts of the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; North India was at the centre of the reforms; millions of acres of land were acquired and redistributed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; The government was also successful in procuring houses for landless labourers; according to [[Francine R. Frankel|Frankel]], three-fourths of the targeted four million houses was achieved in 1975 alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, others have disputed the success of the program and criticized Gandhi for not doing enough to reform land ownership. The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned &quot;...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to &quot;talk left and act right&quot;, referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; [[J. Barkley Rosser, Jr.|Rosser]] wrote that &quot;some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress dissent against Gandhi's policy shift to the right.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosser&quot;/&gt; Regardless of the controversy over the nature of the reforms, the long-term effects of the social changes gave rise to prominence of middle-ranking farmers from intermediate and lower castes in North India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt; The rise of these newly empowered social classes challenged the political establishment of the [[Hindi Belt]] in the years to come.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jaffrelot&quot;/&gt;

===Language policy===
Under the [[Indian Constitution]] of 1950, Hindi was to have become the official national language by 1965. This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government. In 1967, Gandhi made a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages. This established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the non-Hindi speaking Indian states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg&quot;/&gt; Gandhi thus put herself forward as a leader with a pan-Indian vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chandra 2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

===Nuclear Program of India===
{{Main article|Indian nuclear programme|Smiling Buddha}}
Gandhi contributed and further carried out the vision of [[Jawarharalal Nehru]], former Premier of India to develop the program. Gandhi authorised the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in response to the ''[[Test No. 6]]'' by People's Republic of China. Gandhi saw this test as Chinese nuclear intimidation, therefore, Gandhi promoted the views of Nehru to establish India's stability and security interests as independent from those of the nuclear superpowers.

The program became fully mature in 1974, when Dr. [[Raja Ramanna]] reported to Gandhi that India had the ability to test its first nuclear weapon. Gandhi gave verbal authorisation of this [[nuclear testing|test]], and preparations were made in a long-constructed army base, the [[Indian Army]] [[Pokhran Test Range]]. In 1974, India successfully conducted an underground nuclear test, unofficially code named as &quot;''[[Smiling Buddha]]''&quot;, near the desert village of [[Pokhran]] in Rajasthan. As the world was quiet by this test, a vehement protest came forward from Pakistan. Great ire was raised in Pakistan and its Prime Minister, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], described this test as &quot;''Indian hegemony''&quot; to intimidate Pakistan. In response to this [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] launched a massive campaign all over the Pakistan to make Pakistan a nuclear power. In these campaigns [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] asked the nation to get united and great slogans were raised such as ''hum ghaas kha lay gay magar nuclear power ban k rhe gay (we would eat grass but would surely achieve nuclear power)''. Gandhi directed a letter to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] and, later to the world, describing the test for [[Peaceful nuclear explosions|peaceful purposes]] and India's commitment to develop its programme for industrial and scientific use.

==Family, personal life and outlook==
[[Image:Feroze and Indira Gandhi.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Personal Life|Portrait of [[Feroze Gandhi|Feroze]] and Indira Gandhi]]
A member of the [[Nehru-Gandhi family]], she was married to [[Feroze Gandhi]] at the age of 25, in 1942. Their marriage lasted for 18 years, until Feroze died after a [[heart attack]] in 1960. They had two sons – [[Rajiv Gandhi|Rajiv]] (b. 1944) and [[Sanjay Gandhi|Sanjay]] (b. 1946). Her younger son Sanjay had initially been her chosen heir; but after his death in a flying accident in June 1980, Gandhi  persuaded her reluctant elder son Rajiv to quit his job as a pilot and enter politics in February 1981. Rajiv took office as [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] following his mother's [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassination]] in 1984; he served until December 1989. Rajiv Gandhi  himself was assassinated by a suicide bomber working on behalf of [[Tamil tigers]] on May 21, 1991.

Gandhi's yoga guru, [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]], helped her in making certain decisions and also executed certain top level political tasks on her behalf, especially from 1975 to 1977 when Gandhi declared a state of emergency and suspended civil liberties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/10/obituaries/dhirendra-brahmachari-yoga-master-70.html Dhirendra Brahmachari, Yoga Master, 7], ''The New York Times'', 10 June 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?211174 Mrs G's String of Beaus], Outlook India, 26 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on Women===
In 1952 in a letter to her American friend Dorothy Norman, Gandhi wrote: “I am in no sense a feminist, but I believe in women being able to do everything…Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once.” While this statement appears paradoxical, it reflects Gandhi’s complex feelings toward her gender and feminism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman, Dorothy 1985&quot;&gt;Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Her egalitarian upbringing with her cousins helped contribute to her sense of natural equality. “Flying kites, climbing trees, playing marbles with her boy cousins, Indira said she hardly knew the difference between a boy and a girl until the age of twelve.”&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar, Pupul. Indira Gandhi: An Intimate Biography. New York: Pantheon, 1992. Print. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indira Gandhi did not often discuss her gender, but she did involve herself in women’s issues before becoming the prime minister. Before her election as the Prime Minister, she became active in the organizational wing of the Congress party, working in part in the Women’s Department.&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, Gandhi had an active role in setting up the Congress Party’s Women’s Section.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Unsurprisingly, a lot of her involvement stemmed from her father. As an only child, Gandhi naturally stepped into the political light. And, as a female, Gandhi naturally helped head the Women’s section of the Congress Party. She often tried to organize women to involve themselves in politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lovenduski, Joni. Women and European Politics: Contemporary Feminism and Public Policy. Amherst: University of Massachusetts, 1986. Print. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Although rhetorically Gandhi may have attempted to separate her political success from her gender, Gandhi did involve herself in women’s organizations. The political parties in India paid substantial attention to Gandhi’s gender before she became prime minister, hoping to use her for political gain. Because she was a female, other political leaders in India saw Gandhi as weak and hoped to use her as a puppet once elected. “Congress President Kamaraj orchestrated Mrs. Gandhi’s selection as prime minister because he perceived her to be weak enough that he and the other regional party bosses could control her, and yet strong enough to beat Desai [her political opponent] in a party election because of the high regard for her father…a woman would be an ideal tool for the Syndicate…”&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though men surrounded Gandhi during her upbringing, she still had a female role model as a child. Several books on Gandhi mention her interest in Joan of Arc. In her own accounts through her letters she wrote to her friend Dorothy Norman, in 1952 she wrote: “At about eight or nine I was taken to France; Jeanne d’Arc became a great heroine of mine. She was one of the first people I read about with enthusiasm.”&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Another historian recounts India’s comparison of herself to Joan of Arc: “Indira developed a fascination for Joan of Arc, telling her aunt, “Someday I am going to lead my people to freedom just as Joan of Arc did!”&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi’s linking of herself to Joan of Arc presents a nice model for historians to assess Gandhi. As one writer said: “The Indian people were her children; members of her family were the only people capable of leading them.”&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps this transcendental attitude caused Gandhi to remove herself from the collective feminist cause. More likely, her preoccupation with establishing an Indian state took precedence over her fight for women’s rights.  Gandhi had been swept up in the call for Indian independence since she was born in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Indira Gandhi.&quot; About Indira Gandhi. Web. 20 Nov. 2012.
&lt;http://www.indiragandhi.com/aboutindiragandhi.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus by 1947 she was already well immersed in politics, and by 1966, when she first assumed the position of prime minister, she had held several cabinet positions in her father’s office. On February 2, 1959 Gandhi was elected President of the Indian National Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar, Pupul. Indira Gandhi: An Intimate Biography. New York: Pantheon, 1992. Print. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandhi’s advocacy for women’s rights began with her help in establishing the Congress Party’s Women’s Section. In 1956, she wrote in a letter: “It is because of this that I am taking a much more active part in politics. I have to do a great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women’s Section, and am on numerous important committees.”&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Gandhi spent a great deal of time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: “The women, whom I have been trying to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field.”&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Once appointed president in 1959, she “travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP…she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region…”&lt;ref&gt;Jayakar, Pupul. Indira Gandhi: An Intimate Biography. New York: Pantheon, 1992. Print. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi’s actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that “Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman, Dorothy 1985&quot;/&gt;

Gandhi felt guilty about her inability to fully devote her time to her children. She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and “stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.”&lt;ref&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; At another point, she went into more detail: “To a woman, motherhood is the highest fulfilment…To bring a new being into this world, to see its perfection and to dream of its future greatness is the most moving of all experiences and fills one with wonder and exaltation.”&lt;ref&gt;Malhotra, Inder. Indira Gandhi: A Personal and Political Biography. Boston: Northeastern UP, 1989. Print. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians remember Gandhi for her ability to effectively promote Indian foreign policy measures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genovese, Michael A. 1993&quot;&gt;Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Her domestic initiatives did not necessarily reflect favourably on Indian women. Gandhi did not make a special effort to appoint women to cabinet positions. She did not appoint any women to full cabinet rank during her terms in office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genovese, Michael A. 1993&quot;/&gt; Yet despite this, many women saw Gandhi as a symbol for feminism and an image of women’s power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Genovese, Michael A. 1993&quot;/&gt;

'''Intergovernmentalism''' is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name=&quot;japss2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Intergovernmentalism treats states, and national governments in particular, as the primary actors in the integration process. Intergovernmentalist approaches claim to be able to explain both periods of radical change in the [[European Union]] because of converging governmental preferences and periods of inertia because of diverging national interests. Intergovernmentalism is distinguishable from [[realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealism]] because of its recognition of the significance of [[institutionalisation]] in international politics and the impact of domestic politics upon governmental preferences.

The best-known example of regional integration is the [[European Union]] (EU), an [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|economic]] and political intergovernmental organisation of 28 [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], all in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic information on the European Union|url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/basic-information/index_en.htm|work=European Union|publisher=europa.eu|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |title=European |quote=5 b. spec.

The EU has developed a [[single market]] through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. Within the [[Schengen Area]] (which includes 22 EU and 4 non-EU European states) passport controls have been abolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Internal borders&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Schengen area|publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/policies/borders/borders_schengen_en.htm|accessdate=8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU policies favour the [[Internal market|free movement of people, goods, services, and capital]] within its boundaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa Internal Market&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU Single Market: Fewer barriers, more opportunities|publisher=Europa web portal|author=European Commission|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm|accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|title=Activities of the European Union: Internal Market|publisher=Europa web portal|url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm|accessdate=29 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on [[Common commercial policy|trade]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common commercial policy|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226160945/http://europa.eu/scadplus/glossary/commercial_policy_en.htm|work=Europa Glossary|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=19 December 2016|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common Agricultural Policy|agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Council of the European Union|title=Agriculture and Fisheries Council|url=http://www.consilium.eu.int/cms3_fo/showPage.asp?id=414&amp;lang=en&amp;mode=g|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Common Fisheries Policy|fisheries]] and [[Regional policy of the European Union|regional development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of the European Union activities: Regional Policy|url=http://europa.eu/pol/reg/overview_en.htm|publisher=Europa web portal|accessdate=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A monetary union, the [[eurozone]], was established in 1999 and is composed of 17 member states. Through the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]] the EU has developed a role in [[Foreign relations of the European Union|external relations]] and [[Military of the European Union|defence]]. Permanent [[List of diplomatic missions of the European Union|diplomatic missions]] have been established around the world. The EU is represented at the [[European Union and the United Nations|United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organisation]], the [[European Union and the G8|G8]] and the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]].

Intergovernmentalism represents a way for limiting the conferral of powers upon supranational institutions, halting the emergence of common policies. in the current institutional system of the EU, the European Council and the Council play the role of the institutions which have the last word about decisions and policies of the EU, institutionalizing a de facto intergovernmental control over the EU as a whole, with the possibility to give more power to a small group of states. This extreme consequence can create the condition of supremacy of someone over someone else violating the principle of a &quot;Union of Equals&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Laruffa, &quot;The European Integration and National Interests: from an intergovernmental model to a Constitutional Agreement&quot;(Hungarian Academy of Social Sciences, Budapest, 3 July 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

===African Integration===

The '''African Union''' ('''AU''', or, in its other official languages, '''UA''') is a [[Continental union|continental intergovernmental union]], similar but less integrated to the EU, consisting of 54&amp;nbsp;[[Africa]]n [[Sovereign state|states]]. The only all-African state not in the AU is [[Morocco]]. The AU was established on 26 May 2001 in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], and launched on 9 July 2002 in [[South Africa]] to replace the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU).&lt;ref name=&quot;African Union 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url        = http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_&amp;_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union,%209%20July%202002.htm
