Born and raised in <SE-ORG<West_Germany>>, she migrated to Britain in 1974.\nStuart served as Chair and leader of the <SE-ORG<Vote_Leave>> Campaign Committee as Co-Convenor with Conservative <SE-ORG<Michael_Gove>> MP. The Vote Leave campaign was successful in the <SE-ORG<United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016>>. Since September 2016, Stuart has served as Chair of Vote Leave's successor organisation, <SE-ORG<Change_Britain>>.","#Early_life":"Gisela Gschaider was born in <SE-ORG<Velden_(Vils)>>, <SE-ORG<Bavaria>>, and raised in her parents' <SE-ORG<Roman_Catholic>> faith. She attended the <SE-ORG<Realschule>> Vilsbiburg on Amselstraße in <SE-ORG<Vilsbiburg>>.\nAfter serving an apprenticeship in bookselling she moved to Britain in 1974 in order to improve her English and to undertake a Business Studies course at <SE-ORG<Manchester_Metropolitan_University>>. Stuart subsequently relocated to the <SE-ORG<The_Midlands>>.\nShe graduated from the <SE-ORG<University_of_London>> with an <SE-ORG<LLB>> in 1993, having studied through the <SE-ORG<University_of_London_External_System>>. She began researching for a PhD in trust law (ownership of pension funds) at the <SE-ORG<University_of_Birmingham>> whilst also lecturing Law to AAT students at Worcester College, but did not complete her PhD and instead went into politics full-time.\nIn 1994, as Gisela Gschaider, Stuart contested the <SE-ORG<Worcestershire_and_South_Warwickshire_(European_Parliament_constituency)>> seat at the <SE-ORG<European_Elections>> for Labour. She lost by 1,000 votes.","#Parliamentary_career":"In 1995, Stuart was selected as Labour's prospective parliamentary candidate for the <SE-ORG<Birmingham_Edgbaston_(UK_Parliament_constituency)>> constituency. The seat, which had once been held by Prime Minister <SE-ORG<Neville_Chamberlain>>, had been in <SE-ORG<Conservative_Party_(UK)>> hands for 99 years. The incumbent Conservative MP, <SE-ORG<Jill_Knight>>, was retiring after 31 years. On <SE-ORG<United_Kingdom_general_election,_1997>>, Stuart was elected as the first ever Labour MP for the seat, making it one of a succession of traditionally Tory seats swept up in the landslide Labour victory. Stuart's victory was the first televised Labour gain of the evening.\nDuring the first <SE-ORG<Tony_Blair>> premiership, Stuart served on the Social Security Select Committee and in 1998 as PPS to <SE-ORG<Home_Office>> Minister of State <SE-ORG<Paul_Boateng>>, before joining the Government in 1999 as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health. Stuart left the Government in the reshuffle that followed the 2001 General Election. Her election agent in that election was <SE-ORG<John_Clancy_(Labour_politician)>>, who in 2015 became leader of <SE-ORG<Birmingham_City_Council>>.\nIn Blair's second term, Stuart was appointed as one of the UK Parliamentary Representatives to the <SE-ORG<Convention_on_the_Future_of_Europe>>, which was tasked with drawing up a new constitution for the European Union. In this capacity, Stuart also served as one of the 13 members of the Convention's Presidium - the steering group responsible for managing the business of the Convention.\nWhen the draft Constitution emerged, Stuart was amongst its most trenchant critics, stating that it had been drawn up by a \"self-selected group of the European political elite\" determined to deepen European integration. She subsequently expounded these views in a 2004 <SE-ORG<Fabian_Society>> pamphlet, ''\"The Making of Europe's Constitution\"''. Consequently, she has argued in favour of leaving the European Union, thus becoming one of the leading figures in Labour's eurosceptic wing. In the BBC's 2-hour televised debate on the EU referendum, Stuart appeared on the \"Leave\" panel, along with <SE-ORG<Andrea_Leadsom>> and <SE-ORG<Boris_Johnson>>.\nBetween 2001 and 2010, Stuart also served as a member of the House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.\nShe held Birmingham Edgbaston for Labour at the 2005 General Election but her majority was exactly halved in both percentage and numerical terms. Despite the predictions of the pundits, Stuart went on to retain the seat at the <SE-ORG<United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010>>, against a national tide of Labour defeat. Her successful campaign has been seen as a model for a new style of community-based Labour politics. It also earned her the title of Survivor of the Year at The Spectator magazine's 2010 Parliamentarian of the Year awards, which was presented to her by the new Conservative Prime Minister, <SE-ORG<David_Cameron>>. She retained her seat at the 2015 General Election with a majority of 2,706, more than double her majority from 2010.\nShe is a signatory of the <SE-ORG<Henry_Jackson_Society>> principles, which promote the spread of liberal democracy across the world and the maintenance of a strong military with global expeditionary reach. She joined the Commons Select Committee on Defence.\nIn October 2004, she became the only Labour MP who openly supported the re-election of <SE-ORG<George_W._Bush>> in that year's US presidential election, arguing \"you know where you stand with George and, in today's world, that's much better than rudderless leaders who drift with the prevailing wind\". She wrote that a victory for Democratic Party challenger, <SE-ORG<John_Kerry>>, would prompt \"victory celebrations among those who want to destroy liberal democracies. More terrorists and suicide bombers would step forward to become martyrs in their quest to destroy the West\".\nStuart is the editor of the weekly political magazine <SE-ORG<The_House_(magazine)>> magazine.","#Vote_Leave":"Stuart served as Chair of the successful <SE-ORG<Vote_Leave>> campaign during the <SE-ORG<United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum,_2016>>, which opposed the Labour Party <SE-ORG<Labour_In_for_Britain>> campaign. Stuart served as a principal figurehead for Vote Leave, along with Conservative MPs <SE-ORG<Boris_Johnson>> and <SE-ORG<Michael_Gove>>.\nAs chair of Vote Leave she warned that the NHS faced being overun by 88 million migrants from Turkey and the Balkans. She said: \"Rather than sending money abroad to countries that want to join the EU I believe we should be spending our money on our priorities here in the UK.\n\"Instead of giving an extra 88 million people - more than our entire population - access to the NHS I believe it would be safer to take back control.\n\"We should give our struggling NHS the £350m we send to the EU every week.\"","#Voting_record":"How Stuart voted on key matters since 2001:"},"firstSentence":"Gisela Gschaider Stuart is a British Labour Party politician, who has been the Member of Parliament for Birmingham Edgbaston since 1997."}
