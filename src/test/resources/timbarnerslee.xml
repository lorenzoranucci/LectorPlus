'''Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|OM|KBE|FRS|FREng|FRSA|FBCS}} (born 8 June 1955),&lt;ref name=&quot;whoswho&quot; /&gt; also known as '''TimBL''', is an English [[computer science|computer scientist]], best known as the inventor of the [[World Wide Web]]. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html |title=info.cern.ch – Tim Berners-Lee's proposal |publisher=Info.cern.ch |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he implemented the first successful communication between a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]] client and server via the Internet sometime around mid-November of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Berners Lee's own reference.

==Early life and education==
Berners-Lee was born in London, England, United Kingdom,&lt;ref name=&quot;W3Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Longer.html|title=Berners-Lee Longer Biography|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of four children born to [[Mary Lee Woods]] and [[Conway Berners-Lee]]. His parents worked on the first commercially-built computer, the [[Ferranti Mark 1]]. He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south west London's [[Emanuel School]] from 1969 to 1973, at the time a [[direct grant grammar school]], which became an [[independent school]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoswho&quot;&gt;{{Who's Who | surname = BERNERS-LEE | othernames = Sir Timothy (John)  | id = U12699 | volume = 2015 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tecb&quot; /&gt; A keen [[trainspotter]] as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b022ff6c-f673-11e1-9fff-00144feabdc0.html#axzz25mg7CPq7|title=Lunch with the FT: Tim Berners-Lee|work=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] from 1973 to 1976, where he received a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first-class]] [[bachelor of arts]] degree in physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoswho&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;W3Bio&quot; /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Tim Berners-Lee.jpg|thumb|right|Berners-Lee, 2005]]
After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company [[Plessey]] in [[Poole]], Dorset.&lt;ref name=&quot;W3Bio&quot; /&gt; In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in [[Ferndown]], Dorset, where he helped create type-setting software for printers.&lt;ref name=&quot;W3Bio&quot; /&gt;

Berners-Lee worked as an [[independent contractor]] at [[CERN]] from June to December 1980. While in [[Geneva]], he proposed a project based on the concept of [[hypertext]], to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Berners-Lee's original proposal to CERN|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=March 1989|url=http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html|accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named [[ENQUIRE]].&lt;ref name=&quot;linvinginternet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Bill|title=Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and the World Wide Web|url=http://www.livinginternet.com/w/wi_lee.htm|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently asked questions|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=22 July 2010|author=Tim Berners-Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ran the company's technical side for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Wendy|title=All you never knew about the Net ...|newspaper=The Independent|date=15 July 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project he worked on was a &quot;[[real-time computing|real-time]] [[remote procedure call]]&quot; which gave him experience in [[computer network]]ing.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq&quot; /&gt; In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.&lt;ref name=&quot;linvinginternet&quot; /&gt;

In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet:
{{quotation| &quot;I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] and [[domain name system]] ideas and—ta-da!—the World Wide Web&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|title=Answers for Young People|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|url=http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/Kids|accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ... Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like the hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just had to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction, thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger imaginary documentation system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/ber1int-1 |title=Biography and Video Interview of Timothy Berners-Lee at Academy of Achievement |publisher=Achievement.org |accessdate=21 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by Berners-Lee at CERN and became the world's first web server]]
Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by his manager, Mike Sendall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Story/WelcomeStory.html|publisher=CERN|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which he designed and built the first [[Web browser]]. His software also functioned as an editor (called [[WorldWideWeb]], running on the [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system), and the first Web server, [[CERN HTTPd]] (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol [[Daemon (computer software)|daemon]]).

{{quotation| &quot;Mike Sendall buys a NeXT cube for evaluation, and gives it to Tim [Berners-Lee]. Tim's prototype implementation on NeXTStep is made in the space of a few months, thanks to the qualities of the NeXTStep software development system. This prototype offers [[WYSIWYG]] browsing/authoring! Current Web browsers used in &quot;surfing the Internet&quot; are mere passive windows, depriving the user of the possibility to contribute. During some sessions in the CERN cafeteria, Tim and I try to find a catching name for the system. I was determined that the name should not yet again be taken from Greek mythology..... Tim proposes &quot;World-Wide Web&quot;. I like this very much, except that it is difficult to pronounce in French...&quot; by [[Robert Cailliau]], 2 November 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;&gt;[http://www.netvalley.com/cgi-bin/intval/net_history.pl?chapter=4 Roads and Crossroads of Internet History] Chapter 4: Birth of the Web&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:TimBL-112003-Shin-Yokohama.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.75|Berners-Lee using his laptop in 2003]]
The first web site built was at CERN within the border of France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Berners-Lee. Confirming The Exact Location Where the Web Was Invented|url=http://davidgalbraith.org/uncategorized/the-exact-location-where-the-web-was-invented/2343/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was put online on 6 August 1991 for the first time:

{{quotation|'''info.cern.ch''' was the address of the world's first-ever web site and web server, running on a NeXT computer at CERN. The first web page address was http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html, which centred on information regarding the WWW project. Visitors could learn more about hypertext, technical details for creating their own webpage, and even an explanation on how to search the Web for information. There are no screenshots of this original page and, in any case, changes were made daily to the information available on the page as the WWW project developed.

We can connect with each other instantly, all over the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= 80 moments that shaped the world |url= https://www.britishcouncil.org/80moments/?_e_pi_=7%2CPAGE_ID10%2C5655166218 |publisher= [[British Council]] |accessdate= May 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. It comprised various companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the Web. Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they easily could be adopted by anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent Policy—5&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;2004|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=5 February 2004|url=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/|accessdate=25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in [[Colehill]] in [[Wimborne Minster|Wimborne]], [[East Dorset]].&lt;ref&gt;John W. Klooster (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA611&amp;dq=tim+berners+lee++-+east+dorset+heritage+trust&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0cE9TtyhIcyo8QPQx_zgDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20berners%20lee%20%20-%20east%20dorset%20heritage%20trust&amp;f=false Icons of invention: the makers of the modern world from Gutenberg to Gates] p.611. ABC-CLIO, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, he accepted a chair in computer science at the School of Electronics and Computer Science, [[University of Southampton]], Hampshire, to work on the [[Semantic Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Berners-Lee | first1 = T. | authorlink1 = Tim Berners-Lee| last2 = Hendler | first2 = J. | authorlink2 = James Hendler| last3 = Lassila | first3 = O. | authorlink3 = Ora Lassila| doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34 | title = The Semantic Web | journal = [[Scientific American]] | volume = 2841| issue = 5 | pages = 34 | year = 2001 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-semantic-web| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Tim Berners-Lee, World Wide Web inventor, to join ECS| publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date= 2 December 2004| url = http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/news/658| accessdate=25 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[The Times|Times]]'' article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that [[URI scheme#Generic syntax|the initial pair of slashes]] (&quot;//&quot;) in a web address were &quot;unnecessary&quot;. He told the newspaper that he easily could have designed web addresses without the slashes. &quot;There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time,&quot; he said in his lighthearted apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8306631.stm|title=Berners-Lee 'sorry' for slashes|publisher=BBC |date= 14 October 2009|accessdate=14 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, then-British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] announced Berners-Lee would work with the [[UK government]] to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of Information Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Tim Berners-Lee| publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date= 10 June 2009| url = http://www.w3.org/News/2009#item98| accessdate=10 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Berners-Lee and Professor [[Nigel Shadbolt]] are the two key figures behind [[data.gov.uk]], a UK government project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free re-use. Commenting on the opening up of [[Ordnance Survey]] data in April 2010 Berners-Lee said that: &quot;The changes signal a wider cultural change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the public domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other way around.&quot; He went on to say &quot;Greater openness, accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Ordnance Survey offers free data access |publisher=BBC News |date= 1 April 2010| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8597779.stm| accessdate=3 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Berners-Lee launched the [[World Wide Web Foundation]] in order to &quot;advance the Web to empower humanity by launching transformative programs that build local capacity to leverage the Web as a medium for positive change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webfoundation.org/about/faq/ FAQ—World Wide Web Foundation] Retrieved 18 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
