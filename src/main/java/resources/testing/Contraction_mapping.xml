      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], a '''contraction mapping''', or '''contraction''' or '''contractor''', on a [[metric space]] ''(M,d)'' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from ''M'' to itself, with the property that there is some nonnegative [[real number]] &lt;math&gt;0\leq k &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M'',
:&lt;math&gt;d(f(x),f(y))\leq k\,d(x,y).&lt;/math&gt;
The smallest such value of ''k'' is called the '''Lipschitz constant''' of ''f''.  Contractive maps are sometimes called '''Lipschitzian maps'''.  If the above condition is instead satisfied for
''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1, then the mapping is said to be a [[non-expansive map]].

More generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces. Thus, if (''M'',''d'') and (''N'',''d''') are two metric spaces, and &lt;math&gt;f:M \rightarrow N&lt;/math&gt;, then there is a constant &lt;math&gt;k &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;d'(f(x),f(y))\leq k\,d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''M''.

Every contraction mapping is [[Lipschitz continuous]] and hence [[uniformly continuous]] (for a Lipschitz continuous function, the constant ''k'' is no longer necessarily less than 1).

A contraction mapping has at most one [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]. Moreover, the [[Banach fixed point theorem]] states that every contraction mapping on a nonempty [[complete metric space]] has a unique fixed point, and that for any ''x'' in ''M'' the [[iterated function]] sequence ''x'', ''f'' (''x''), ''f'' (''f'' (''x'')), ''f'' (''f'' (''f'' (''x''))), ... converges to the fixed point. This concept is very useful for [[iterated function systems]] where contraction mappings are often used. Banach's fixed point theorem is also applied in proving the existence of solutions of ordinary differential equations, and is used in one proof of the [[inverse function theorem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shifrin&quot;&gt;Theodore Shifrin, ''Multivariable Mathematics'', Wiley, 2005, ISBN 0-471-52638-X, pp.&amp;nbsp;244–260.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Firmly non-expansive mapping==
A non-expansive mapping with &lt;math&gt;k=1&lt;/math&gt; can be strengthened to a '''firmly non-expansive mapping''' in a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' if the following holds for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''H'':
:&lt;math&gt;\|f(x)-f(y) \|^2 \leq \, \langle x-y, f(x) - f(y) \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;d(x,y) = \|x-y\|&lt;/math&gt;

This is a special case of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; averaged nonexpansive operators with &lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Solving monotone inclusions via compositions of nonexpansive averaged operators'', Patrick L. Combettes, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; A firmly non-expansive mapping is always non-expansive, via the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]].

==Subcontraction map==
A '''subcontraction map''' or '''subcontractor''' is a map ''f'' on a metric space (''M'',''d'') such that

:&lt;math&gt; d(f(x), f(y)) \le d(x,y) \ ; &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d(f(f(x)),f(x)) &lt; d(f(x),x) \quad \text{unless} \quad x = f(x) \ . &lt;/math&gt;

If the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of a subcontractor ''f'' is [[Compact space|compact]], then ''f'' has a fixed point.&lt;ref name=Gold17&gt;Goldstein (1967) p.17&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hausdorff dimension''' is a concept in [[mathematics]] introduced in 1918 by [[mathematician]] [[Felix Hausdorff]], and it serves as a measure of the local size of a set of numbers (i.e., a &quot;space&quot;), taking into account the distance between each of its members (i.e., the &quot;points&quot; in the &quot;space&quot;). Applying its mathematical formalisms provides that the Hausdorff dimension of a single [[point (geometry)|point]] is zero, of a [[line (geometry)|line]] is 1, and of a [[square]] is 2, of a [[cube]] is 3. That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners—the shapes of traditional geometry and science—the Hausdorff dimension is a ''counting number'' ([[integer]]) agreeing with [[Inductive dimension|a dimension corresponding to its topology]]. However, formalisms have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects, where, based solely on its properties of [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]] and [[self-similarity]], one is led to the conclusion that particular objects—including [[fractal]]s—have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. Because of the significant technical advances made by [[Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch]] allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular sets, this dimension is also commonly referred to as the ''Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension.''

The Hausdorff dimension is, more specifically, a further dimensional number associated with a given set of numbers, where the distances between all members of that set are defined, and where the dimension is drawn from the [[real number]]s, ℝ, to which two elements have been added, +∞ and −∞ (read as positive and negative infinity, respectively). The set that provides the Hausdorff dimension is called the [[Extended real number line|extended real numbers]], {{Overline|R}}, and a set of numbers where distances between all members are defined is termed a [[metric space]],&lt;ref&gt;The distances, taken together, are called a [[metric space|metric]] on the set.&lt;/ref&gt; so that foregoing can be succinctly stated, saying the Hausdorff dimension is a non-negative [[extended real number line|extended real number]] ({{Overline|R}} ≥ 0) associated with any [[metric space]].

In mathematical terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real [[vector space]]. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an ''n''-dimensional [[inner product space]] equals ''n''. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that [[fractal|irregular sets]] can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the [[Koch snowflake|Koch curve]] summarized earlier is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new [[equilateral]] triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Riddle, 2014, &quot;Classic Iterated Function Systems: Koch Snowflake&quot;, Agnes Scott College e-Academy (online), see [http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/ksnow/ksnow.htm], accessed 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original.&lt;ref name=CampbellAnnenberg15/&gt; Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=ClaytonSCTPLS96&gt;Keith Clayton, 1996, &quot;Fractals and the Fractal Dimension,&quot; ''Basic Concepts in Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos'' (workshop), Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology and the Life Sciences annual meeting, June 28, 1996, Berkeley, California, see [http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/psychology/cogsci/chaos/workshop/Workshop.html], accessed 5 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving—in the Koch and other fractal cases—non-integer dimensions for these objects.

The Hausdorff dimension is a successor to the simpler, but usually equivalent, box-counting or [[Minkowski–Bouligand dimension]].

==Intuition==
{{technical|date=March 2015}}
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
The intuitive concept of dimension of a geometric object ''X'' is the number of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the [[cardinality]] of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the [[real line]] (this can be seen by an [[Cantor's diagonal argument|argument]] involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information.) The example of a [[space-filling curve]] shows that one can even take one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and ''continuously'', so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.

Every space filling curve hits some points multiple times, and does not have a continuous inverse. It is impossible to map two dimensions onto one in a way that is continuous and continuously invertible. The topological dimension, also called [[Lebesgue covering dimension]], explains why. This dimension is ''n'' if, in every covering of ''X'' by small open balls, there is at least one point where ''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 balls overlap. For example, when one covers a line with short open intervals, some points must be covered twice, giving dimension&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

But topological dimension is a very crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve that is almost space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it fills up most of the area of a region. A [[fractal]] has an integer topological dimension, but in terms of the amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.

The Hausdorff dimension measures the local size of a space taking into account the distance between points, the [[metric space|metric]]. Consider the number ''N''(''r'') of [[ball (mathematics)|balls]] of radius at most ''r'' required to cover ''X'' completely. When ''r'' is very small, ''N''(''r'') grows polynomially with 1/''r''. For a sufficiently well-behaved  ''X'', the Hausdorff dimension is the unique number ''d'' such that N(''r'') grows as 1/''r&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;'' as ''r'' approaches zero. More precisely, this defines the [[Minkowski–Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]], which equals the Hausdorff dimension when the value ''d'' is a critical boundary between growth rates that are insufficient to cover the space, and growth rates that are overabundant.

For shapes that are smooth, or shapes with a small number of corners, the shapes of traditional geometry and science, the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the topological dimension. But [[Benoît Mandelbrot]] observed that [[fractal]]s, sets with noninteger Hausdorff dimensions, are found everywhere in nature. He observed that the proper idealization of most rough shapes you see around you is not in terms of smooth idealized shapes, but in terms of fractal idealized shapes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.&lt;ref name=&quot;mandelbrot&quot;&gt;{{cite book   | last = Mandelbrot   | first = Benoît   | authorlink = Benoît Mandelbrot   | title = The Fractal Geometry of Nature   | publisher = W. H. Freeman   | series = Lecture notes in mathematics 1358   | year = 1982   | doi =   | isbn = 0-7167-1186-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For fractals that occur in nature, the Hausdorff and [[Minkowski–Bouligand dimension|box-counting dimension]] coincide. The [[packing dimension]] is yet another similar notion which gives the same value for many shapes, but there are well documented exceptions where all these dimensions differ.

==Formal definitions==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2015}}

===Hausdorff content===
Let ''X'' be a [[metric space]]. If ''S'' ⊂ ''X'' and ''d'' ∈ [0, ∞), the ''d''-dimensional '''Hausdorff content''' of ''S'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;C_H^d(S):=\inf\Bigl\{\sum_i r_i^d:\text{ there is a cover of } S\text{ by balls with radii }r_i&gt;0\Bigr\}.&lt;/math&gt;
In other words, &lt;math&gt;C_H^d(S)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[infimum]] of the set of numbers δ ≥ 0 such that there is some (indexed) collection of [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]s &lt;math&gt;\{B(x_i,r_i):i\in I\}&lt;/math&gt; covering ''S'' with ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 for each ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I'' that satisfies &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i\in I} r_i^d&lt;\delta &lt;/math&gt;. (Here, we use the standard convention that [[infimum|inf&amp;nbsp;Ø&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;∞]].)

===Hausdorff dimension===
The '''Hausdorff dimension''' of ''X'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\dim_{\operatorname{H}}(X):=\inf\{d\ge 0: C_H^d(X)=0\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, dim&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') may be defined as the [[infimum]] of the set of ''d'' ∈ [0, ∞) such that the ''d''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]] of ''X'' is zero. This is the same as the supremum of the set of ''d''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;∞) such that the ''d''-dimensional Hausdorff measure of ''X'' is infinite (except that when this latter set of numbers ''d'' is empty the Hausdorff dimension is zero).

==Properties of Hausdorff dimension==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

=== Hausdorff dimension and inductive dimension ===
Let ''X'' be an arbitrary [[Separable space|separable]] metric space. There is a [[topology|topological]] notion of [[inductive dimension]] for ''X'' which is defined recursively. It is always an integer (or +∞) and is denoted dim&lt;sub&gt;ind&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'').

'''Theorem'''. Suppose ''X'' is non-empty. Then 
:&lt;math&gt; \dim_{\mathrm{Haus}}(X) \geq \dim_{\operatorname{ind}}(X). &lt;/math&gt;
Moreover,
:&lt;math&gt; \inf_Y \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(Y) =\dim_{\operatorname{ind}}(X), &lt;/math&gt;
where ''Y'' ranges over metric spaces [[homeomorphic]] to ''X''. In other words, ''X'' and ''Y'' have the same underlying set of points and the metric ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''Y'' is topologically equivalent to ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

These results were originally established by [[Edward Szpilrajn]] (1907–1976), e.g., see Hurewicz and Wallman, Chapter VII.{{full|date=March 2015}}

=== Hausdorff dimension and Minkowski dimension ===
The [[Minkowski dimension]] is similar to, and at least as large as, the Hausdorff dimension, and they are equal in many situations. However, the set of [[rational number|rational]] points in [0, 1] has Hausdorff dimension zero and Minkowski dimension one. There are also compact sets for which the Minkowski dimension is strictly larger than the Hausdorff dimension.

=== Hausdorff dimensions and Frostman measures ===
If there is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] μ defined on [[Borel measure|Borel]] subsets of a metric space ''X'' such that ''μ''(''X'') &gt; 0 and ''μ''(''B''(''x'', ''r'')) ≤ ''r&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' holds for some constant ''s'' &gt; 0 and for every ball ''B''(''x'', ''r'') in ''X'', then dim&lt;sub&gt;Haus&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') ≥ ''s''. A partial converse is provided by [[Frostman's lemma]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;This Wikipedia article also discusses further useful characterizations of the Hausdorff dimension.{{clarify|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Behaviour under unions and products ===
If &lt;math&gt;X=\bigcup_{i\in I}X_i&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or countable union, then

:&lt;math&gt; \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(X) =\sup_{i\in I} \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(X_i).&lt;/math&gt;

This can be verified directly from the definition.

If ''X'' and ''Y'' are non-empty metric spaces, then the Hausdorff dimension of their product satisfies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marstrand, J. M. |title=The dimension of Cartesian product sets |journal=Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=198–202 |year=1954 |doi=10.1017/S0305004100029236 |bibcode = 1954PCPS...50..198M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(X\times Y)\ge \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(X)+ \dim_{\operatorname{Haus}}(Y).&lt;/math&gt;

This inequality can be strict. It is possible to find two sets of dimension 0 whose product has dimension 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Falconer  | first = Kenneth J.  | title = Fractal geometry. Mathematical foundations and applications  | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey  | year = 2003  | doi =   | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposite direction, it is known that when ''X'' and ''Y'' are Borel subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the Hausdorff dimension of ''X'' × ''Y'' is bounded from above by the Hausdorff dimension of ''X'' plus the [[packing dimension|upper packing dimension]] of ''Y''. These facts are discussed in Mattila (1995).
===The Hausdorff Dimension Theorem===
'''Theorem'''. For any given &lt;math&gt; r&gt;0,  &lt;/math&gt; there are uncountable fractals with Hausdorff dimension &lt;math&gt; r   &lt;/math&gt; in n-dimensional Euclidean space &lt;math&gt; R^{n}, (n \geq \lceil r \rceil). &lt;/math&gt;   &lt;ref&gt;   Mohsen Soltanifar.(2006).On A sequence of cantor Fractals, Rose Hulman Undergraduate Mathematics Journal, Vol 7, No 1, paper 9,  &lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-similar sets==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
Many sets defined by a self-similarity condition have dimensions which can be determined explicitly. Roughly, a set ''E'' is self-similar if it is the fixed point of a set-valued transformation ψ, that is ψ(''E'') = ''E'', although the exact definition is given below.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Theorem'''. Suppose

:&lt;math&gt; \psi_i: \mathbf{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbf{R}^n, \quad i=1, \ldots , m &lt;/math&gt;

are [[Contraction mapping|contractive]] mappings on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with contraction constant ''r&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; 1. Then there is a unique ''non-empty'' compact set ''A'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; A = \bigcup_{i=1}^m \psi_i (A). &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The theorem follows from [[Stefan Banach]]'s [[Contractive mapping theorem|contractive mapping fixed point theorem]] applied to the complete metric space of non-empty compact subsets of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with the [[Hausdorff distance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Falconer, K. J. |title=The Geometry of Fractal Sets |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1985 |isbn=0-521-25694-1 |chapter=Theorem 8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The open set condition===
To determine the dimension of the self-similar set ''A'' (in certain cases), we need a technical condition called the ''open set condition'' (OSC) on the sequence of contractions ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

There is a relatively compact open set ''V'' such that

:&lt;math&gt; \bigcup_{i=1}^m\psi_i (V) \subseteq V, &lt;/math&gt;

where the sets in union on the left are pairwise [[disjoint sets|disjoint]].

The open set condition is a separation condition that ensures the images ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'') do not overlap &quot;too much&quot;.

'''Theorem'''. Suppose the open set condition holds and each ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a similitude, that is a composition of an [[isometry]] and a [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]] around some point. Then the unique fixed point of ψ is a set whose Hausdorff dimension is ''s'' where ''s'' is the unique solution of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hutchinson | first=John E. | title=Fractals and self similarity | journal=Indiana Univ. Math. J. | volume=30 | year=1981 | pages=713–747 | doi=10.1512/iumj.1981.30.30055 | issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^m r_i^s = 1. &lt;/math&gt;

The contraction coefficient of a similitude is the magnitude of the dilation.

We can use this theorem to compute the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle (or sometimes called Sierpinski gasket). Consider three [[non-collinear points]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and let ψ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be the dilation of ratio 1/2 around ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. The unique non-empty fixed point of the corresponding mapping ψ is a Sierpinski gasket and the dimension ''s'' is the unique solution of
:&lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s+\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s = 3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^s =1. &lt;/math&gt;

Taking [[natural logarithm]]s of both sides of the above equation, we can solve for ''s'', that is: ''s'' = ln(3)/ln(2).  The Sierpinski gasket is self-similar and satisfies the OSC. In general a set ''E'' which is a fixed point of a mapping

: &lt;math&gt; A \mapsto \psi(A) = \bigcup_{i=1}^m \psi_i(A) &lt;/math&gt;

is self-similar if and only if the intersections

:&lt;math&gt; H^s\left(\psi_i(E) \cap \psi_j(E)\right) =0, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the Hausdorff dimension of ''E'' and ''H&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' denotes [[Hausdorff measure]]. This is clear in the case of the Sierpinski gasket (the intersections are just points), but is also true more generally:

'''Theorem'''. Under the same conditions as the previous theorem, the unique fixed point of ψ is self-similar.
